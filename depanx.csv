I came out to my family as lesbian. Mom told me I should go kill myself.,3671,False,"17 F
All my life I've lived in a small little ""redneck"" town in North Carolina with conservative parents. My Dad is a pastor at our local church and both of my parents are EXTREMELY religious. They both hate gay people. I've known I was gay since I was a child but have always been scared about coming out in fear that they would reject me because they are very homophobic people. Whenever my parents see someone gay on TV they always say things like ""Look at that fucking faggot"" or ""That's disgusting"" and it just breaks my heart. I hate living with those fucking homophobes and I always take out my hatred by cutting myself. So far I've cut around 30 scars all over my thighs, butt, legs, and lower back. No one has ever seen these scars because I always wear jeans to cover them. At least not until a few days ago.

We were having a baby shower for my cousin and my mom insisted I wear a short ugly little dress that comes up to about my lower thigh. You could see every single fucking scar on my legs. I tried my best to cover the scars with my arms but when I stood up after dinner she saw them. She pointed at my legs and asked me what the hell is that so I told her everything. About how depressed I've been. About how many times I've contemplated suicide over the last few months. And about how I'm a lesbian. 

My parents flipped the fuck out.

My dad started screaming a bunch of religious shit while throwing food at me. He told me that being gay was a sin and I was going to hell for this. He told me he didn't want ""no faggot daughter"". Then he angrily stomped out the room. My mom just looked at me in disgust for a few minutes before she spoke. She said, and these are her exact words, ""Just kill yourself you gay little bitch, you're not my daughter anymore.""

That's all. She just said that and walked out.

It's been two days since that happened and now my parents refuse to talk to me. When they see me around the house they just ignore me like I'm not even there.

I feel empty all the time, yeah, I have a diagnosis, yeah, but I still manage to doubt myself anyways. It almost feels like it’s normal to feel empty. It’s strange when people tell me they can do their school work, have a job, and feel happy by second nature. It seems like feeling this way is normal, but I also feel like I’m alone in this? It’s weird. I tell myself things like, “this isn’t because of the depression, it’s because you’re worthless and incapable of doing anything.” I tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing.

This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night.

But the instant we say we’re giving up, everyone’s like “Oh no! You have so much to live for! Think about x,y, and z! You can’t give up! Things are gonna get better!” Yeah, shove it up your ass. You’re just trying to make sure your conscience is clean when I’m dead and gone. You think you care, but you’re really just being cautious for yourself and trying to save your own soul while acting to save another. Good luck with that. I’m tired of being told to get help. With what fucking money? All just to talk to some damn superficial person who is literally being paid to be a friend to me because I’m so fucking shit at doing it without paying? What the hell is the point of trying? I’m stuck here, just like I’ll always be. Just give me the freedom to take my leave. I’ll be happy then, but I’ll be decaying in the ground by then.

Today was my 21st birthday,1771,False,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers.

I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday. I'm very nervous, but relieved. I really hope things get better from now on so I can have a normal life again. :)",bu3v78,depression,150

People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.,1653,False,"UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Regular Check-In Post,1628,False,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support.

",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/anh7tv/regular_checkin_post/,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.

I’m sorry I’m not the best mum. I’m sorry I get so distracted. I’m sorry that sometimes my head is too cloudy to give you my all. I am really trying. This isn’t anything how I pictured parenthood being. I am struggling to keep up with the image of being ok 24/7. Just know that I love you. I stay alive for you. I keep myself in my place for you. Because I’m your mama. 
Sometimes I feel like I don’t deserve you. Sometimes I feel like I’m doing the worst job. Sometimes I feel like I’ve failed you. I want to sing songs to you. I want to talk to you. I want to do all of these things that mother and sons do together. Sometimes I struggle to eat a full meal and I feel guilty that I don’t have plenty of milk to feed you properly. You cry. I feel ashamed. I feel like I’ve let you down. I wake up thinking “I don’t want to get out of bed today” but I do, just for you. Because I love you. But why do I feel so hopeless? Why does my heart ache for you every single day? My baby, this is draining my soul. The anxiety I go through just to get money for us. Sitting in the office and having a series of attacks. Mummy is tired. Mummy is drained. Mummy wants to be happy just for you. I want to be all these things for you just so you feel whole. I didn’t want this for us. You don’t deserve to be put with a mum like me. I am a terrible mother but I’m trying my best for you. Postpartum depression is evil. It’s robbing my mind and it’s hurting mummy. I turn on my phone and it’s the only thing I’m glued to. I feel like the worlds worst mum. I feel guilty that I can’t even look you in the eyes sometimes just because of how bad I feel that you’re stuck with someone like me. You deserve better. My misery makes me forget to just hold you and give you a cuddle. Not paying enough attention brings me down even more. You’re a blessing. You’re the greatest gift that I’ve ever been given and I’m guilty because I’m not doing my job properly. I feel ungrateful. I love you so much, my honey. I feel so helpless because I have no one to talk to. I get told to get over it or stop being so sad and enjoy all of these moments. But it’s harder than it seems. I didn’t ask for this. I am trying my darling. I am trying so hard for you, you will see one day. I want to get help. But I’m afraid of being turned away. Afraid of people saying that it’s all my fault or that I’m just being stupid and emotional or to stop crying because trust me, I wish I could. Time is so precious and I’m wasting it by moping around. I’m wasting all this time to watch you grow by being distracted with my own thoughts. You are growing so fast. In the blink of an eye you’ve grown from size 0000 to 00 in just under 2 months. No matter what I am your mummy. I feel defeated and drained but I will always love you. I will always nurture you. I will always care for you. I feed you. I do everything for you despite my heart ache. I do all of my duties as a mother. I am strong just for you even though I ride through all of this pain. You keep me going. This isn’t a cry for help but just a reminder that I am trying my best to be strong.

My girlfriend died,1360,False,"Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive.

I don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though.

After about two years I got myself together and attended college though. Right now in my life I’m almost about to graduate from college. Not in film/ photography, but I think she would be proud of me.

I wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that I lost someone so important. Losing her was like losing half of my being. 

Lately I’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as I graduate. I wish she was here.   
It feels good to write this though. 

For about three years I had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately I’ve felt the desire to do so. I hope someday I find someone I can love as much as I loved her.

",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a46ol5/my_girlfriend_died/,"Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. 

That night I could not sleep at all. The next night I slept maybe a few hours. My life took a sharp turn when she died. I was so much more lively and joyful – I just became dull and lifeless. I felt lifeless as well. This is kinda random, but I never grew my hair out growing up. It was always buzzed short, but when she died I kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years.

My experience after surviving suicide..,1211,False,"My therapist suggested maybe writing things down to help process emotions, and hell if it can help anyone else..


In June 2017 i took a walk to a park that would forever change my life, I had everything planned out perfectly, i was ready.

I tied the rope around a branch and the other end around my neck, i had wrapped my hoodie around my neck underneath the rope, i didn't want to feel the rope directly on my skin and for some reason having some cotton between my skin and the rope made me feel better.

After some hesitation, i eventually let myself drop, it wasn't a big drop, my neck certainly didn't break..but i felt a large amount of pressure in my head very suddenly, it didn't take long before what felt like a huge headrush take over and i began to lose conciousness.

Then, i woke up..on the floor with a dark figure stood over me, it was a security guard...i didn't even know the park had any sort of security.

He had cut me down and was checking if i was breathing, when he realised i was alive he didn't say much. I think i had shocked him way out of his comfort zone. I refused to let him call the police but i eventually allowed him to call the hospital, i was struggling to breath. My head was all over the place.

The man had saved my life but i was so caught up in the shock and chaos i never even thought to thank him.

I was in hospital for the night, they treated the wound on my neck, the cotton hoodie i had wedged between my neck and the rope hadn't done much to protect my skin. The hospital put me in suicide watch and the next day i was with a specialist doctor discussing what had happened and getting me access to the support i needed.

The police did turn up, but they only really enquired why i had not called them, calling the police on myself was never something i had ever really considered.

After about 30 hours or so I was taken home, i wasn't allowed to be alone so my ""Emergency contact"" my Ma, had to be with me. This was probably the most difficult conversation i have ever had in my life. Witnessing the expression on my mothers face as she learns that i had hung myself isnt something i will forget anytime soon, i had destroyed her, she was trying to compose herself but she broke down.

No amount of pain i had previously been subjected to was anything compared to what i felt witnessing that.

She had questions, i answered them without feeling the need to downplay or under exaggerate how i had felt for a large portion of my life, somehow in the recent events i had found the strength to talk to my mother about things i would just suppress before. We discussed my fathers abuse throughout my childhood and teenage years, something we had never talked about and i was not the only victim, but i did recieve the worst of the violence.

My most vivid memories from my childhood are me running down the stairs and hitting my father with pillows  to try and stop him hurting my mum, as i got older that violence was pushed onto me.

I don't know how much sense this post is making, but it really was my mum who brought me back from this.


It was at that point i decided i was no longer going to live the life i had chosen to end. 

I was going to live a better life, take big risk, drop everything and persue my dreams. I cut out all the toxic people from my life at that point, i don't miss them. I ditched my depressing job, I bought a Motorbike (cliche i know)

Motorbikes are pretty damn good for mental health, just saying.

I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab.

Or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them?
Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from?

How is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? Not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive.

I’m out,1177,False,"Hi guys,


I just wanted to let you all know I feel well enough to finally say goodbye to this sub. I have gotten a lot of support here, got some good advice and made a great friend. 

Whenever things go South again, I’ll know I have this safe space to return to.

Thank you all, and best of luck. You can do this. 

EDIT: I thought you guys might want to know what kind of things I tried and what worked. I took 3 different kinds of antidepressants, I'm now on Paroxetine and they seem to work. I've tried therapists and that's not my jam. I spent 3 days in a psych ward after my overdose and I hated it there (other patients loved it though). The thing that worked most for me was reading. I read Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. Also: the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk. And if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. And I'm here. PM me, I promise I'll reply.",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/856z53/im_out/,"Hi guys,

No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy,1052,False,"I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me

Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too.

I sold my guns.,1006,False,"They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes.

You can never have an honest conversation about suicide,991,False,"When I was 18, someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note. I had planned on killing myself at the end of that week. The following events were an absolute  shit storm.

This is my plan” then I’m going to get thrown back into the Psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety”

This is how I tried to explain to my (gamer) friend how depression feels like:,987,False,"When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this. Thought I'd share it, maybe people can relate to it.

EDIT: Thank you all so much. It means a lot to me that it means a lot to you.

""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on.

And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free.

But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? 

So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. 

It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.

At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point?

You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.

By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.

When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape.""

EDIT 2: Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in.

""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing.""",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/22jqpo/this_is_how_i_tried_to_explain_to_my_gamer_friend/,"When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this.

"So I have this virus ""depression.exe"" on my computer...",985,False,"About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.

So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.

The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.

The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU.

Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.

It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model.

I don't know how it's possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel EVERYTHING. EVERY FUCKING THING. I can't breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes. So many thoughts running through my head at once. Every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things. All at once. And yet if you were to look at me, you would see the most blank, dull empty stare. I'm nothing. And yet my mind tries to be everything haha. Such a broken piece of shit. 

I think about hurting myself and dying a lot. It used to scare me. I remember the first time I genuinely thought about killing myself. It scared me. And it kinda felt good that that's how I reacted. But that was ages ago. It's so common now, it's just part of what it is to be me.


Insignificant. 



***Hey, Thank you everyone for the response. ***
When I typed this out, I didn't expect it to get noticed and I almost didn't send it again haha. I just thought 'fuck it what have I got to lose'. But I'm glad I did, I cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me. People who have commented or messaged me personally and said that I hit a personal note to them. It means a lot to me, I'm sorry if I don't get around to replying to everyone (you know how it is) but believe me that I appreciate this more than you know. 
In the future I will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send. Much love.",59449g,depression,445

What depression isn't.,970,False,"Depression isn't an emotion. Depression has no cause. Too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety.

Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.

A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope.

Currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. Luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. I wish I'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. Pills are not worth it man. Probably fucked my liver up for life. 

Oh and only one person has visited me. A friend. None of my family have so much as messaged me to see if I'm okay. I'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. How fucking dare they! I'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. I fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.

Sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.


Update:
I'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. I knew this community was amazing already but I've never made an actual post before (I'm using a alt account so when I shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) 
You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days.

Jasmine ",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6pgoal/attempted_suicide_last_night_now_im_being_guarded/,"So last night I got desperate and attempted suicide in the most stupid way. I took a bunch of pills with a lot of vodka. I would have chosen something more effective if I had thought about it more and I'm so mad at myself right now. I had the chance to die and I ruined it by saying goodbye to my friends who then proceeded to call the paramedics on me. I refused to go with them so then I got fucking detained and handcuffs. Cos the best way to deal with suicidal people is to fucking treat them like criminals 👍
Currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. Luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. I wish I'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. Pills are not worth it man. Probably fucked my liver up for life. 

Oh and only one person has visited me. A friend. None of my family have so much as messaged me to see if I'm okay. I'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. How fucking dare they! I'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. I fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.

Sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.


Update:
I'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. I knew this community was amazing already but I've never made an actual post before (I'm using a alt account so when I shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) 
You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days.

This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.  

* Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  

* Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  

* Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  

* If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  

* Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide.

My wife committed suicide yesterday,863,False,"My wife was struggling with depression for about 6 months. She attempted overdosing in December, but I found out and called an ambulance. Yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while I was out. I don't know why I'm writing this.

She operated normally as far as I could tell, but was fixated on this idea. I noticed she got worse recently but I believed it was because she was putting  pressure on herself to get back to work. I guess I was wrong.  

She thought I would be better off without her. That the pain I was going through watching her was too much for me. I truly believe that when she jumped she was partially doing it to free me. I wish I could tell her how wrong she was.

Girlfriend attempted suicide. I'm a wreck.,847,False,"I posted this on /r/suicidewatch before I realized this sub existed.

We have been dating for 7 months. I don't believe in love at first sight, but we fell in love pretty fast. We are great together. I can't imagine my life without her.

We both struggle with depression. I was suicidal a few years back, so I can understand what she is going through. I have been medicated for the past year and pretty ok; I convinced her to seek help, so she has been medicated for the past 4 months or so. Anyway....

I had just arrived at work. Only been there about 20 minutes, when I receive a phone call from her. We both hate talking on the phone, so when she calls it's usually because she can't text, so I answered and she was babbling; slurring; crying; the only thing I could understand was, ""I did it. I'm sorry.""

I bolted out of the office. She lives about 20 minutes away and by the time I got there she was in her bed laying there. I thought she was dead. I can't remember ever being that scared. I walked over to her and she was still conscious and sobbing. She had downed a bottle of wine and taken all her Klonopin.

I was able to get her dressed and take her to the hospital. She's in a mental health facility now and getting the help she needs. I'm just so afraid that when she gets out, she is going to try again and this time I'm not going to be there to save her.

I understand that it has nothing to do with me. I understand depression. I've been in a place, where no matter how much someone loves you, it's not enough. But, I can't help but beat myself up. I'm about as mushy and kind as they come. Spontaneous flowers, love poems, genuinely want to spend all my time hanging out with her, I listen and hang on her ever word, basically I know I'm a good and loving boyfriend. She kept repeating, ""I don't know why you love me so much. I'm horrible."" I tried to tell her that's not true.

Leaving her at the facility was so hard. She cried so much. She wouldn't let go of me when it was time for her to go. It's been almost a week and I miss her so much. We are never apart.

I know I'm doing everything I can. I just needed to rant and get some alternate perspectives. I went through a divorce a year ago and my circle of friends is relatively null, so I don't have a ton of people to talk to.

I'm depressed as fuck now. It's like this whole situation has made old memories and feelings come surging back. I'm not suicidal, but I sure would like to sleep for a couple of centuries. This is tough.

The Robin Williams Posts Are Triggering,837,False,"*Edit: My use of ""triggering"" in the title refers to how I felt reading articles and comments regarding Robin Williams on the night of, not the anger I felt the next day after having time to think and refresh.*

It angers me to see posts saying ""If only Robin Williams knew how many people cared/ loved him/ are sad now."" In my bouts with depression, I wouldn't have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care; or 10 page letters; or a 16-hour phone call. I'd still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think, *They don't really care. They just don't want my death on their conscience.* I'd bet money Robin Williams was the same way. Who could be more loved than a funny-man?


When someone tells me [in the context of suicide] ""I'd be sad if you died,"" I think, *Great, so I should endure my pain every day because you don't want to feel pain yourself.* I think, *How selfish.* How is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain? It's easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain. They don't feel it. They don't see it. Because if I show it, ""Hey, perk up. Be happy. Turn that frown upside down."" Depression isn't an on/ off switch.


And so I never want someone to do something they don't want to do. I can remember one time that all I wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend, but I couldn't bring myself to say that. I didn't want my friend to play just because I asked or out of some moral obligation. (And I know that if I did, at the end I'd hear ""Do you feel better?"" as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me ""less sad."") Instead I just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening, watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me.

Rick and Morty had one of the most realistic suicide attempts I've ever seen on television,827,False,"So episode 3 of the new season, at the end, Rick walks past his family, being a bit more quiet than usual, then walks downstairs and comes very close to completing suicide (he passes out at the last second.)

When I see a suicidal person on TV I feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. Maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. Now this obviously does happen, but I don't think it's the majority of attempts.

If you're standing on the edge of a building or taking any sort of steps towards suicide because you feel that's the only way you're going to get help, then you are really desperate for help.)

Anyway, for a person who has been suicidal for a long time and doesn't want anybody interfering, I feel like this  is so much closer to how it goes down. Family is home, they don't notice much different about the person, and it's completed without a lot of fanfare. You just want it done. It reminded me of Hunter S Thompson's suicide. His adult son was in the next room and thought he'd heard a book drop.

Rick is also one of the only characters I can think of that has depression and successfully hides it. He comes off as angry and mean, which is exactly what my husband has been saying about me. I'm angry all the fucking time. Because I'm in pain and I want to die, and I've used up all the fucks I had to give just getting out of bed today. I have no patience or kindness left for people annoying me or being stupid. Still, most people who know me have no idea how sick I am until I tell them.  

Rick and Morty likes to make you laugh at something, then force you to think about why you were laughing. Rick is a funny old drunk grandpa. Old people who are always taking swigs  from their flask and don't give a fuck are funny, right? Except nobody drinks like that without a reason. Healthy people do not need to be constantly drunk, the hangovers and cost to your health are enough to keep most people to some sort of reasonable level of consumption. Also, most people just don't feel the need to drink from when they wake up to when they pass out.

When I see a suicidal person on TV I feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. Maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. Now this obviously does happen, but I don't think it's the majority of attempts.

"I'm 24. My father died, my girlfriend left, my mother killed herself, and my sister was just admitted to a psych hospital. In the span of 4 months.",788,False,"I've been a subscriber to r/depression for a long time; I suffer from both depression and anxiety, and am currently taking medication that helps considerably. 

I guess I just need to get it all of my chest, and I apologize if it's a bit long. 

My parents divorced December 2012. After that, my father and I became very close, as my mother was exhibiting very selfish and irrational behavior that ended up pushing a lot of people away. My father was my mentor. He was my friend. He was a great man. 

In December of 2013, he passed away at 48. I'm 24. It was horrendous. I lost him, and was thrown into a massive storm of shit to deal with since I was the executor of his estate. 

A few weeks before his death, I began dating a girl. She was the perfect fit for me. She was smart, caring, and incredibly empathetic. When my dad passed, she began spending a lot of time at my house with me and my friends. She helped me through a lot. 

About a month and a half ago, she left. A half-cocked story about needing to find herself, and now I'm on my own, and still dealing with the aftermath of my fathers death. 

I was still not on good terms with my mom. She was not being a mother. She continued to disrespect my fathers memory, portray herself as a victim, and cut down the ones I cared about. Time and time again I gave her a chance to step up, and she failed to. 

This past week, my mother committed suicide. She wrote out her list of next of kin, took a handful of prescription strength sleep aids, and went to sleep for the last time. She decided she would rather be dead than reconcile the relationship she had with her children. 

My sister was just admitted under a 5150 as a last ditch effort for her to end her self destructive ways and get her life on track. It doesn't look promising. 

I sit here, smoking a cigarette, with my two dead parents dogs lying at my feet, and am overwhelmed by anger, loneliness, and defeat. 

I'm trying to keep myself from shutting myself away from the world and crawling back to my old hermit ways.

Being African-American and having a mental illness is literally the worst combo there is,758,False,"I just want to start off by saying that mental illness doesn't discriminate when it chooses its victims, I am just speaking from my perspective.

In no way am I saying that my mental health struggles are harder than people who comes from a different racial background, but it is difficult when you come from a community that stigmatizes and fails to recognize mental health as a REAL issue. From my personal experience and those of other black people I know, majority of us grew up being told that ""we're being ungrateful, weak, crazy or sad for no damn reason."" I am sure that other people have been told these things as well, but this is all too prevalent in the black community.

Recently, I have sought out professional help after experiencing a mental breakdown on campus. I was extremely grateful to be paired with an understanding psychologist. After the school year ended, I came back home and had told my parents of my experience with this doctor and exclaimed how much he helped hoping it would change their mind about going to a doctor, but they shot down the mere thought that anything outside of the bible could help me. The claim that ""going to doctors is what the 'world' does (they're pretty religious). All they want to do is put people on pills"". That is the furthest thing from the truth. Not once did the man I met with suggested that I be placed on any sort of medication and even if I were, I would be willing to if I needed it.

I hate that I am nothing like my family. If I believed in god, they would be more accepting of me. But I am at the point in my life where I feel that I want to believe in what feels right for me. I want to be my own person, not who anyone else wants me to be.

Was a recovering heroin addict that was on suboxone for the past 9 months and recently tapered off...  After an argument she went out and bought heroin, wrote a suicide note, and then proceeded to do it via overdose. I haven't read the note, and I'm afraid of what it's going to say. I'm so completely crushed. Every day since then I've literally cried from the moment I wake up, and throughout the day randomly until I physically can't cry anymore...  I feel like this has really messed me up in the head. I don't know what to do... Everything I do reminds me of her, and I feel extremely guilty for even feeling the slightest bit of happiness at any time. Idk if a therapist will work.... because I don't know if I want to feel happy after this...  I'm not suicidal... but I honestly don't know if I'll ever recover from this.

Edit: This has also left me financially crushed... Not going into details right now... But I'm going to have to break our apartment lease and move home with my father... might get sued for a few reasons here.... God.. help me",61k2k7,depression,650

Anyone else been depressed since childhood?,738,False,"I don't see it being discussed much. It makes me feel rather isolated. I don't think I even remember joy. I only seem to recall fear and deep sadness.

Wife is dying and I feel so lonely.,727,False,"I've suffered with depression all my life, I was raised by narcissistic parents and spent most of my life feeling alone and like I didn't fit in. My wife was the same, and when we found each other we found more than a spouse, but someone who could relate. I can't describe my love for her, we complete each other.

Around 5 years ago she was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer for the second time (at age 20) whilst she was pregnant with our daughter. We lost our daughter to stillbirth, but my wife somehow pulled through, had chemo and got an all-clear.

During this time both of our families proved themselves to be thoroughly selfish, useless and downright nasty so we both went no contact and it was the best thing we did. After four years of healing we got married and life seemed to be getting on track.

Last month I took my wife to A&E because she was passing out and having trouble getting her blood sugar under control, only for them to tell us, after a few more tests, that despite having no ovaries left the cancer had returned, somehow spread to her lung and liver and there is next to nothing they can do.

She is due to start chemo soon, and is in an awful lot of pain. She has been prescribed morphine for it, but due to that spends most of the time sleeping, while I sit here and watch over her, making sure she is ok.

The trouble is I can't talk to her about any of this, it's too painful for her to do anything but ignore at the moment but I'm devastated and alone. Besides, how I feel should be the least of her worries at the moment and I don't want to put that on her.

I feel like I'm already grieving her even though she is still here, I'm completely alone with no-one to lean on for support.

Depression is humiliating,706,False,"It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything. 

You alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. 

If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world.

A year and a half ago I was bullied at work and forced to quit. I've worked side jobs ever since and have been too afraid to apply for jobs in my field (medical assisting and gi technical specialist). I have nightmares still about my past work place. I truly am still afraid of working side by side with someone again and having them spread lies about me. 

My depression has been it's worst this year after my doctor had me lower my anti depression drug dosage because I was feeling better after a year taking my increased dosage. I soon spiraled into a mess. I financially have been struggling and that has constantly been a worry for me. Many days I stay in bed and do not shower, brush my teeth or eat. I currently cannot sleep at night without the aid of sleeping pills. I do take them now though, that's something I usually haven't done.

But a couple months ago I updated my resume, applied to jobs, went on interviews..and was hired (part time) by a local hospital with my start date being tomorrow. 

From that interview to now, yeah, I've still had a rough time. I haven't paid this month's rent and can't afford to. But I finally showered. I brushed my teeth this morning. I'll brush my teeth tomorrow morning and actually go to work. 

I'M GOING TO WORK. My new manager seems like a great person. I'm still filled with anxiety but this is an entirely new hospital system, all new (to me)people and this gets my foot in the door for a full time position when/if one opens. Plus I'll be soon helping patients again and using my seven years of experience of advanced GI procedures.

The guys looked like they were from the 80s with what they wore and their glasses and hair. I didn't participate in that conversation but I suppose I am now.

Just a few more decades and you'll die naturally :) Hang in there, every day is a living hell with no respite from the emotional numbness/pain, but do it anyway :) Depression causes you to be a worthless failure because you don't have the motivation to further your career or social life, but hang in there as a complete loser!

Then of course the natural progression beyond 'someone' is a 'therapist.' ""Talk to a therapist and get help."" Ok, let me just pull money out of my ass, and pay hundreds of dollars for someone who probably won't be able to do shit for me anyway. But that's another story...",5i74xb,depression,786

Does anyone else procrastinate to a ridiculous degree?,665,False,"So I procrastinate far *far* too much. Absolutely nothing motivates me to do work any more. Nothing at all. Back in high school I was a pretty good student. I got all my work done on time, literally never missed an assignment etc. But in college, I just can't bring myself to do anything. 

I have a huge project that needs to be completed and the idea was that we'd do a few weeks of work in class and the rest at home. Ever since the class sessions ended, I haven't even looked at it. And it was due to be finished 2 weeks ago. I open the file, look at it for a couple of minutes and then put it away. In part, it is because I find it incredibly difficult (and yes, I have asked for help but none of it made it any easier for me) but it's also because I've pretty much just fallen into a pit of inescapable procrastination. I wake up way too late, stay in bed for at least an hour after waking up, sit around playing video games, glance at my work, play more video games and then go back to bed. For god's sake, I even put off making this post for a week.

My girlfriend took her own life today. I don't know how to handle this.,660,False,"She texted me to say good bye while I was gone for a couple hours today. I was busy and didn't even see the message for 30 minutes. She was gone by the time I got back home. She had been fighting depression and I guess she lost. I called friends and family for support right after 911. They've been with me all day, but now that everyone is sleeping, I can't. The image of her hanging there will haunt me until my dying days. That was my baby, my better half. Falling asleep without her at my side just feels wrong. There's a huge hole in me and I don't know what to do or how to handle it. I just cry, I've been crying since 3pm. My face hurts, hell, my whole body hurts. To anyone that has lost their love, how did you handle it? What gave you the will to want to go another day? Or anyone that just wants to talk, keep my mind off that image. Not suicidal though, couldn't imagine putting someone through what I'm feeling.

Thanks for the kind wishes everyone. The xanax has finally kicked, in chest isnt hurting so much and I'm cross-eyed.hopefully be able to get some sleep. Can't take any more tonight.

I was able to get a few hours of sleep this morning from the xanax. Spent today with friends keeping me busy, I haven't cared about any of it. I've been out of it, just following them around, nothing matters to me anymore. I know the sun shown today, but I didnt notice it. I've caught myself pulling out in traffic without looking, not on purpose now but it has happened a couple of times. Not sure why, I guess it just doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm gonna quit driving for now. My school friend said our college has grief counseling. I will be going there in the morning. I knoweveryone is trying their best to help me, but I'm just cold. Cold and hurting and it seems to be getting worse. Tonight will be rough again. 

Everyone is sleeping again and I've taken my xanax so I apologize for spelling errors and  whatnot. Just wanted to give some back story. Beyond an abusive family she had, gang raped, losing her son 3 years ago today, losing her mother to suicide 2 years ago today. She was the most compassionate person to me. She had tried this before before we met. We didn't find, never did. Once when I did get upset with her, I caught her heating up a lighter tip and buring.her self eith. I'll finish this in the morminf

It's night time again, this is starting to feel like a journal. I want to thank everyone for their kind words and support, being able to read your encouragements and relatable stories  throughout my day has helped, more than I can express in text. Today has been one fucking hard day to put it lightly. I got some answers to my questions on why what happened did happen and that only raised more questions. I'll give an censored cliff note version to keep from airing her dirty laundry in the public, but I think its important for me to write this down. And I apologize from typing errors too, been doing this on my phone as my computer is still in the apartment. My gf wasn't from here, I never met or talked to any of her family. I didn't even know their names. She told me that there was a really bad childhood for her and that she had lost 2 children  with her husband years back. So I never asked questions, I just listened when she felt like she needed to talk about it. Eventually, she finally told me there was a younger 3rd child that was still alive with the now ex husband. She said they divorced when the children died, on Oct 15. Fast forward a year, her mother took her own life on Oct 15 for the guilt of feeling responsible. That was 2 years ago.we started dating in no November of last year. She started seeing a therapist for the past 3 months this year that was a very nice lady that she trusted. Well then her incident occurs from the guilt and grief, she blamed her self for those deaths which was completely unwarranted. The coroner had no idea of how to get in touch with family, so that's been my goal since then. I got in touch with the ex husband and an old close friend of hers from back then. I wasn't prepared for theinfo they had about her. The reason shed been crying and putting herself through hell, didn't exist. Well her mom was gone but not for what I was told. There was only two sons and they were both alive, she basically drove off one day and never came back. That was a few months before we met. She liveds those lies for the year everyone kew her here. I talked to her therapist and she was just blown away. All we can figure was that she was so much more mentally dustrurbed than any of us had any idea. Therapist figures she was delusional, maybe borderline schizo. There was really nothing we could've done to help her given the info we didn't know, it was like throwing a bucket of water on a house fire. Id here her talking to herself, but now I'm not sure that she wasn't just having conversations with someone she thought that was there. She would tell me about her conversations shed been having with her old friends that she was able to get in touch with, that really haven't heard from her in over a year. It's just so much to process. Shed actually be excited that she got to talk to them. She believed her delusion so strongly, no one had a reason to doubt it. This just makes things clearer and so much more sad.

My Wife Killed Herself Last Week.,658,False,"About a week ago my wife left the apartment, bought a gun, drove somewhere secluded, pulled over and shot herself. I have been with her since 2007 when we were still in high school. We became adults together.

I have always had mildish depression and anxiety, but she has always had major depression and suicidal ideation. It just kept getting worse and worse. She tried all sorts of medications, therapy (including DBT). She had a partial diagnosis for BPD as well.

I'm not even exactly sure why I am posting here other than to vent a bit. I see a regular therapist and have an appointment monday. I am also on an SSRI already, so I am taking the proper steps. I just am so beside myself. I always knew it would happen. She told me it would and that there was no way to change it. I lived in constant fear and anxiety that she would have a breakdown or even kill herself. I had to make so many excuses for her to my family throughout the years. I could always tell they disproved (even if only a little bit) of me putting so much effort into her. I think they better understand now.

I do not mean to be dramatic, but I feel like, even though I do not regret being with her, it has tormented me in a deep, possibility irreversible way. I know she never meant to harm me and it was the depressed train of thinking she had, but only about a week before she killed herself, I finally got her to admit what I suspected for a long time. She was distancing herself from me for 8 months in order to soften the blow of her suicide. For 8 months at least, she was purposefully distant, did not even try to console me when the situation became too hard for me. I felt so alone. I hate myself for being just a bit relieved that she is dead, because the pain of seeing her suffer was so unimaginably hard to bear.

I feel so angry at her parents, especially her mom, for always putting her down. Making her feel worthless. Her mother is the literal worst person I know. She always acted as if she supported her daughter in everything she did when out in public, but in private she shit on everything she did. My wife was literally a genius at least according to the IQ tests the doctors gave her when diagnosing her mental illnesses. She was an incredible artist who painted, drew, sewed, wood burned, and a shit ton of other things. Anything art, she could do. And her parents hated that, because she did not want to join the Navy like them or go into business. She wanted to teach and almost achieved her dreams before the depression worsened to the point that she quit school and work.

I just wish could have been different for her. All she ever wanted to do was help people and make the world better. I just want to sit on my ass and play video games. Why here and not me. I work in corrections and see a bunch of scum everyday who love the fuck out of themselves. Why not them. She never hurt a god damn soul.

Edit: A name.

Edit 2: I just want everyone to know that I was hesitant about even posting anything about my situation, but I am glad that I did because it has been very therapeutic. I only have two people in my life that really understand depression and how it affect one's thoughts, feeling and beliefs. Most of the people in my life just do not have the ability to comprehend what happened and I am both glad and deeply saddened that the people here do. So thank you everyone.

Edit 3: Thank you kind stranger for the gold. I think I know who is was, but I will just leave it at that.

"I'm almost 24, and have completely wasted the past 5-6 years of my life. I'm in such a dark place and don't know what to do.",650,False,"Hi there, I'm a 23 year old male who turns 24 in August. I have been struggling with depression for a few years now, and it's all coming to a sort of unbearable boiling point. I have completely, entirely wasted the 18-23 phase of my life, and I'm completely devastated about it.

If you'll excuse this, I'm going to allow myself to be dramatic and expressive in this post. I just need to get this out, throw it out in the world and see if anyone can help me. 

Honestly, I can say I've struggled with this all my life, but it's been more severe since 18. All I did in my younger years was play video games. I didn't learn a skill that would blossom into a career, I didn't grow into a man. I stayed a child, and I am a child now. In high school, all I did was waste my potential and genuine ability so I could play games and not have to think about responsibility. My senior year I didn't even apply for a college. I graduated and went to a community college even though I didn't know why I was there. 

From that point, all I did was aimlessly fail school for 3 years (18-21), meet a toxic girl (first love) that broke my heart after a 6 month relationship (21-almost 22), and instead of being a strong person and pushing through the heartbreak, I then let that heartbreak tumble into a toxic rut of depression that lasted for a year, where I left school and did absolutely nothing but work an unsustainable job (delivery driver with my own car that is now almost used up), lay around, and put on 50 pounds. Once that depressive period related to my ex was over, I realized with shock that I had done absolutely nothing during that time and failed an opportunity to gain inner strength. So what did I do? Did I snap out of it and start climbing upward? No. I was so horrified, and I slid into an even darker, existential depression that has lasted up to current day and is reaching a boiling point. 

The ""good"" news is that after three semesters of just laying around (not even using the time off to do something adventurous or awesome), I started back into school this spring, and though my GPA is shit from my earlier failings, I will almost surely finish with A's in both my two classes this semester. I still have no idea what I want to do long-term, but I'm ok with that. 

What I'm realizing now is sort of an exponentially increased version of what I realized after my first rut. I now realize that not only have I done nothing with my recent time, but I've done nothing during the entire 18-23 period of my life but wallow, and I will never be able to do it over. I'm almost 24, and I'm starting to feel my perception of time speed up. This is quite honestly making me panic severely. I feel like I'm going to blink and be 40, then blink again and be 70. I don't really know what to say. I feel so up against it. I could have spent the last 5 years actually finding myself, or traveling, backpacking, adventuring. At the very least I could have been responsible and had my B.S by now, and NOW I could be adventurous for a period before getting a job or going to grad school.

But now I won't finish my degree until I'm 26 or 27, and I could be 33 before I'm done if I want to pursue further education. I see people who are 18, 19, 20 and going on adventures, taking advantage of that time. People I know. And it makes me sob inside. 

I feel that there is some neoteny going on here. The thought of the magic of childhood ending has always been too much for me to think about. I feel that these years are a result of this. I was terrified to grow up. Now I'm at the age where I'm on the roller coaster of adult time with or without my permission, and I wasted those precious, fun transition years.

I wish I had done SOMETHING responsible in the past 6 years. I wish  I had worked hard, maybe learned a trade in my teens so I could have moved out, felt secure, and pursued a fulfilling career with my feet under me. I can't bear the weight of the situation I've put myself into. I can't even think about it straight enough to organize this post. The only responsible thing I've done is pay off 2k in debt last year. That's it.

My parents look at me with this look in their eyes. Like they're thinking, ""what is he doing with his life?"", that they can sense the personal Hell I've boxed myself up in. The reality of this is so damn final. 

Every time I watch a movie, I have this sort of sorrowful pang in my heart as I watch the heroism of the characters. Spiderman made me long to be 18 and start my youthful adult adventure, but do it right this time. Even about my childhood, I feel the same way. If I see a character in a movie being taught by his father to be a self-sufficient man, it makes me desperately wish I had spent my youth building skills, or learning self-sufficiency instead of gaming and ... gaming.

I just don't know what to do. My heart BEGS to have another chance, and I of course know that's an impossibility, so I feel paralyzed by finality. 

This part about my time perception speeding me up is what really  started this boiling point. I'm cracking under the weight of it. I want to grow into being a man, learn skills, become secure and self-sufficient, go on adventures, have a period of joyful expression and free adventure before I have to walk into the monotony of adulthood. But now, even if I do these things, I'll push my degree off even further, or my bank account even lower, and I'll be in my 30's before I even get to where most people are at my current age. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know what I should do. I don't even really know what I want to do. I don't want to be 24. I don't want to have this weight on me. I want to take this darkness and use it to make me stronger, wiser, more experienced, self-sufficient, mature in the truest sense of the word. I want to experience a full 50-60-70 more years, not a cheapened, sped up version that only feels 20 youthful years. I just want to conquer this, and finally experience fulfillment, adventure and joy.",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8all7y/im_almost_24_and_have_completely_wasted_the_past/,"Hi there, I'm a 23 year old male who turns 24 in August. I have been struggling with depression for a few years now, and it's all coming to a sort of unbearable boiling point. I have completely, entirely wasted the 18-23 phase of my life, and I'm completely devastated about it.

If you'll excuse this, I'm going to allow myself to be dramatic and expressive in this post. I just need to get this out, throw it out in the world and see if anyone can help me. 

Honestly, I can say I've struggled with this all my life, but it's been more severe since 18. All I did in my younger years was play video games. I didn't learn a skill that would blossom into a career, I didn't grow into a man. I stayed a child, and I am a child now. In high school, all I did was waste my potential and genuine ability so I could play games and not have to think about responsibility. My senior year I didn't even apply for a college. I graduated and went to a community college even though I didn't know why I was there. 

From that point, all I did was aimlessly fail school for 3 years (18-21), meet a toxic girl (first love) that broke my heart after a 6 month relationship (21-almost 22), and instead of being a strong person and pushing through the heartbreak, I then let that heartbreak tumble into a toxic rut of depression that lasted for a year, where I left school and did absolutely nothing but work an unsustainable job (delivery driver with my own car that is now almost used up), lay around, and put on 50 pounds. Once that depressive period related to my ex was over, I realized with shock that I had done absolutely nothing during that time and failed an opportunity to gain inner strength. So what did I do? Did I snap out of it and start climbing upward? No. I was so horrified, and I slid into an even darker, existential depression that has lasted up to current day and is reaching a boiling point.

"I decided to ""come out of the closet"" about suicidal depression on Facebook when Robin Williams died. It went better than I thought it would. My friends were extremely supportive. This is what I posted.",652,False,"Hey, friends! Today I want to talk about suicidal depression. Every time there's a big suicide in the news, I see a lot of conversation that makes me concerned. It seems like depression is a problem that lots of people don't understand very well. I'm sorry this is so long, but it's an issue that's very close to me. 

I see people say things like ""It was the coward's way out"" or ""he threw it all away over nothing."" You should understand that depression is extremely real to people who are struggling with it. It's an illness. Your brain isn't working properly, the same way a broken limb doesn't work properly. Instead of being unable to walk, you're unable to process positive feelings. You're constantly in a state of sadness, or anger, or fear, or self-loathing. This is a lifelong condition for many people. You can develop coping strategies, but there's no real ""cure"" or universal answer. If that imagery is not helpful, it's like having goblins in your brain. It's like fighting an enemy every single day that you can't see who makes it impossible for you to be happy. It doesn't matter that you have all these nice things and people who love you, because you physically can't enjoy them or anything else. That's a really hard way to live. It hurts me when I hear people with depression described as ""weak."" They have to be strong and brave everyday, just to leave their house or have social interactions. These are people fighting a war that makes it difficult or painful to do very basic things. It is tragic when someone dies fighting that battle, but it is not shameful. 

The second thing I want to talk about is dismissive solutions. I LOVE that treatment for mental illness is becoming more socially acceptable. However, it seems like some people think the conversation ends at ""Get help."" ""If only he had gotten help!"" ""Why didn't he get help?"" ""Why didn't he dial H-E-L-P on the phone so the Helpers in the Help Van could take him to the Helpatorium?"" It is absolutely important to tell people ""get help."" It is sometimes a little patronizing when it's coming from people who don't understand how hard that is. I've seen this taken to a very nasty place, where people say things like ""it's his fault for not getting help. Why should I have sympathy?"" If you're struggling with depression, I want to stress that seeking help absolutely should be the most important thing in your life after basic survival necessities. If you've never struggled with depression, I want to stress that seeking help can be MUCH harder than you think it is. 

I have struggled with suicidal depression for most of my adult life. I called the suicide hotline back when I was delivering pizzas. It is not a magical fix-everything service. They told me their nearest facility was further away than I could afford to drive on my gas budget. I've tried talking about depression to most of my friends. I'm fortunate to have some great people in my life, but I've lost a lot of relationships because I was open about depression. There are people who don't understand, and they get angry at you when their misguided attempts to help don't work. There are people who just slowly back out of your life because talking to you makes them sad or uncomfortable. I don't blame these people. It is very difficult to deal with someone else's depression. That's nobody's fault, but it makes depression very isolating. I've tried to get professional help many times. I've had doctors who were helpful, but we couldn't afford them. I've had doctors who were unhelpful and made things worse. I've been put on medications that made me better for a little while. I've been put on medications that messed me up so badly I couldn't leave my house and had to switch high schools. This is not even getting into how hard it can be emotionally to seek treatment. You have to be able to admit your deepest problems to yourself, and talk about them articulately with total strangers. I don't know a lot of people who can do that, even without depression. It is very difficult to seek any sort of treatment at all when you honestly don't like yourself and don't believe you deserve to get better. I'm not telling this as a sob story to try and garner sympathy. I just want people to understand that everybody struggling with depression has stories like this. We almost never talk about them because we are trying to pretend to be normal.

I hate when posts like this are all criticism, so I'll try to leave with something helpful. You have so much more power than you think you do to help another person. Even when you don't feel like you're making a difference, the smallest acts of kindness can really touch people in unexpected ways. You probably don't understand depression. That is okay! We appreciate it when you are honest about not understanding. We're sick of people telling us they understand when they don't. You don't have to understand. You just have to believe us.

Dad died. No family left. Slowly drowning in bills and debt. Now I'm the sole provider for a household and I'm about to have a complete mental breakdown [29/M],642,False,"I really need some help.

Last year my Dad died from a spontaneous heart attack at the age of 66.  Zero warning.  One minute we're just talking about seeing a movie the next weekend, and the next morning the coroner woke me up pounding on the door saying he dropped dead in his truck two blocks from the house on the way to work.

Ironically, he was in great shape and we worked out every weekend.  He didn't smoke or drink and his doctor said he had the fitness of someone half his age.  He was the pinnacle of health at that age, and this happens somehow.

He was my only family and I'd been living with him for a few years after graduating college.  I'm one of those ""probably borderline autistic, zero social life"" kind of weirdos, who was in a position where his Dad told me I could just live with him, work my job, and spend free time working on my passion, which was writing soundtrack music.

In an instant my whole world - the only person who ever mattered - was ripped away from me.  The tiny life insurance dried up in a year after settling the estate and his debts and the funeral, and I'm sitting here in my office right now just about ready to scream uncontrollably.

There are so many bills, so so many bills, and my job can barely cover them.  My fiancee has been out of work for two years due to an injury and I'm supporting both of us, while trying to maintain the house, with no friends or other family to speak of, and it's a battle I'm slowly losing every day.

I don't have any time for myself any more.  I don't have time to exercise, don't have time to clean, don't have time to make music, don't have time to go back to school to get another degree that hopefully pays better than the first because I'm just at the end of my rope.

And above all else I miss my dad, every single day.

The one ""saving grace"" is that I also inherited his retirement account, which ironically he was never able to even touch.  And now I can't touch it until I'm 65 either, and I don't think I'll make it that far.  I honestly worry about being homeless, about having my whole life wasted because I'm so alone with this burden of a room filling with water and I can only take out one tiny bucket at a time.

And I feel locked within my own body and totally unable to do anything.  Some days I go to sleep and honestly hope I never wake up.

I hate this.  I hate everything.  I hate myself and this whole situation and all the people who were so mean to me my whole life, only to end up in a happy place with my Dad and then to have him taken away with no warning, no explanation, and no way to stop.

Every day of my life I want to cry, to breathe, to take a break from all this stress and sadness, and yet I have to get up and drag myself to this office because otherwise my fiancee and I will not be able to survive.

I need a break from all of this, but I can't, because my entire existence is tied to me working and trying to keep my head above water.

I don't know what to do.

My partner of 5 years dumped me. I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I lost my job. Haven't talked to anyone or been out of the house in weeks. Yesterday a good friend died from suicide. It's too much.,644,False,"A lot has happened in a very short amount of time. When shit hits it really hits hard.

After the breakup I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I'm in therapy and on meds now, which helps a bit. But it's still so bad that I had to quit my job. I just couldn't go back there. I haven't spoken to anyone, except sent a few texts, since new years. I don't go out of the house except to go to therapy. I'm too afraid. I've shut myself in and everyone else out. My friends send me texts now and then. I know they care, but I just don't have the strengt to answer them.

Yesterday I got texts telling me that a good friend, the kindest guy I ever knew, had died from suicide. I feel so guilty. How could I not have known? What is I hadn't shut him (and everyone else) out. What if I could have talked him out if it? 

With depression comes thoughts of hopelessness, despair, feelings of not being good enough, being worthless. A failure. I've felt all those things. But right now I don't just feel it. It IS me. I don't feel like a failure, I am a failure. 

There are so many 'what if's'. What if I could have saved the relationship. What if I could have saved my connection with my friends. What if I had tried harder. What if I had pushed myself and went back to work. What if I could have saved my friend.

Battling depression is a skill. Here are some tips that worked for me.,635,False,"After battling depression over the last year, I have come to discover some tips that have improved the overall quality of my life. The first, and most important discovery, was a change in the way I perceived happiness. Before my bout with depression, I assumed that happiness was my natural state of mind and that being happy is just inherent. Happiness was my baseline, I didn’t have to do anything, and I just was content. Of course, this all changed once the darkness came creeping in, and eventually my baseline emotional state was grey. Here’s what I discovered; being happy takes effort. Being happy is a skill and needs to be worked on. Thinking that you can magically become happy, or not depressed, without changing any aspect of your life is absurd. Once I got my mind around this concept, I worked on my emotional wellbeing every day. It’s a lot like weight lifting. It takes a lot of effort, it isn’t easy, and it takes a while before you see results. However, it is completely worth it in the end. 
Not everyone will derive joy from the same activities that are pleasant for me, but I will share my experience in the hopes that it helps you out. Here are the simple things I added to my life that helped lift the apathy, sadness and empty dullness I was stuck in: 

1)	**Talking about it.** I got in touch with a counselor and talked about it. We literally just sat in a room and chatted back and forth about my feelings for an hour a week. After a few weeks it really started to help. I was also fortunate to have a very loving and caring SO that put up with me while I battled through the darker times. 

2)	**Putting away the booze.** I don’t think I had a problem with booze, but it wasn’t improving the quality of my life, so I stopped drinking. Made a difference. 

3)	**Exercising. Seriously.** It might sounds cliché, but holy shit does this ever help out. Lifting weights and doing hard cardio was amazing for my mental health. While you are busting your ass in the gym or at home, you leave your problems for a brief amount of time and focus on completing tasks at hand. Lift that fucking weight 7 more times, that’s all I have to do, just lift it. The physical pain and concentration to just do simple body movements, matched the pain I was feeling inside and I was finally able to match my mind and body. Being exhausted physically felt great, and it released endorphins that gave me a much needed boost for hours after a workout. It also helped with my energy levels throughout the day, I was able to feel better and more energetic, which translated into happiness over time. Walk around the block, go for a run, do a few pushups in your room, just do it, get out of breath, push yourself for no reason, feel your body, get in the moment.

4)	**Gardening.** I never planted shit before. On a whim I bought some peat pellets, some hot pepper seeds and a few plastic containers – about a $15 investment. Best money I’ve ever spent. The process of germinating seeds, watering plants, taking care of them, and seeing weekly progress is fantastic. I read up on gardening, visited some subreddits and picked up a new hobby. I live in a tiny apartment in the middle of the city, but I have a window with sunlight and that’s all you need. Having nature around you will make you feel better, get a plant. Grow something. Take care of it, and it will take care of you. Try it out. 

5)	**Meditation.** I still suck at it, but it works. Every morning before work I take 5 minutes for myself. I just sit on the floor in my living room, look out the window and breathe. 20 deep breaths, focusing on the act of breathing. In, out, in, out. Simple. I added stretching into the mix. Stretch, breathe. 5 minutes, not a lot of time, not a lot of effort, but the mental clarity achieved is great. Stop reading this right now, take a deep breath, as deep as you can, and breathe it out. Do it again 2 more times. Try it, right now.

6)	**Vitamins and water.** Omega 3 (fish oil), Vitamin B, Multivitamin, Vitamin D. Take them. Especially the Omega 3 and Vitamin B. After only a couple days of supplementing my nutrition with extra vitamins I noticed a difference in my mood. Drink lots of water. More than you are currently drinking now. It’s not hard, go fill up a glass and drink some water. Plenty of articles out there on the link between proper nutrition levels, hydration and mental health. 

7)	**Daily log and journal.** The world isn’t out to get you, people aren’t out to get you, your problems are not impossible to deal with, but they do need to be addressed. This was hard for me to learn. Pick 1 daily goal. That’s it. What do you want to accomplish today? What completed task would take a little weight off your shoulders? Need to make a phone call? Need to pay a bill? Need to wash your sheets? Once task, one goal, per day. Write it down, that’s important. Write down your goal, and write down if you completed your goal at the end of the day. You might not reach your goal every day, but you need to try. The feeling from accomplishing tasks is great, even the small one, just recognize what needs to be done, make a goal, and try. Do it right now, open up notepad or get a pen and paper, and write down the date and what you’d like to get done today. Big or small. Just try. 

8)	**Small improvements.** Do something small that enhances your hygiene and/or appearance. Get a haircut, trim/shave, paint your nails, shower, wash your face, cut your toenails, brush your teeth, whatever. Do something easy that makes your appearance slightly better. Use some mouthwash; make your breath smell a little better. Doesn’t matter what you do, just make a tiny adjustment, a tiny improvement. Lots of tiny improvements over time make a big difference. Take care of your body, and it will influence your mental state. Look better, feel better, be better. Small, tiny incremental improvements. You will get a boost from completing the task, and overtime this adds up. 

9)	**Understand that it is a journey.** It’s hard. For you, and for me, happiness is not baseline. Our normal, everyday feelings are not happy. That’s ok. You can work towards a better life. Some of the shit that I mentioned above takes 5 minutes. The activities aren’t hard, most are enjoyable, what’s hard is bringing yourself to commit to them. Just fucking try it, please. Pick a couple and try it out. You’re taking a small step to taking back being in charge of your mental wellbeing. Yeah you didn’t choose to be depressed, I know, and probably feel like you have no control over your current state. You can help turn the tides. I went from daily suicidal thoughts, to being able to crack a smile here and there. You owe it to yourself to try. I think you can do it. You’re awesome.  

EDIT: Speaka_Engrish brought up a great point - Just to tag on to number 8, keep your room clean! Make your bed, wash the dishes, don't let little problems pile up; take care of them sooner and eventually it becomes second nature. A clean room is analogous to a clean mind.

EDIT 2: AndNowIKnowWhy made another great suggestion - Find a creative thing you like and maybe are even good at. ""Making"" something can become very meditative and self-asserting. Whether it's drawing or doing something with fabrics, wood, clay, metal, styropor, papermaché, threads or whatnot, it is an alternative form of meditation for people who are not into more common forms of it. 

Just don't do it to create something perfect, but rather to just create for the fun of it. It can be very stimulating and I like to create useful stuff for my household. Just googling the words ""easy diy"" and hit the image search will provide you with tons of ideas of which might be for you. also r/crafts, r/diy and all the other subs linked there might be an inspiration to find the right choice of material for you.

I just spent the past 15 minutes sobbing in the bathroom at work because it finally hit me that I have no friends,626,False,"It’s not their fault, it’s mine. I had tons of friends in high school, we hung out almost every day. I was always over at someone’s house, saving sleepovers, playing games. 

After high school I kept in touch with a few but you separate and move on somewhat right? Made two friends in university, I dropped out after my first semester and just started working, everyday. I was and still am too ashamed to see some people because while they’ve gone on to do good things and good schools and good jobs I’m doing nothing with my life. I’m fatter, stopped caring about my looks, boring, working a dead end job. Every-time someone asked to hangout I said I was already working. Eventually people stop messaging. Eventually people stop caring. 

I just finished up my shift and was scrolling through Instagram after getting changed. I’m alone at work and I’m just waiting for my wet mop patch to dry so I’m just standing around in the bathroom being lazy and waiting. Someone’s picture scrolls by of their birthday celebration, it’s in black and white, they’ve got big silver balloons behind them with their age, they’re dressed up, they’ve got a little tiara on their head, she looks happy and she’s tagged her friends who she’s out with. I knew her in school, not really friends and I’ve seen tons of pictures like that before loads of times, especially on Instagram.  For some reason it just struck me, being happy out with friends, someone’s taking their picture, celebrating their birthday, they’ve got a little tiara and they look like a friggan princess. My birthdays coming up and I just realized no one will ever do that for me. I haven’t been ‘out with the girls’ like that in almost 5 years. No ones going to take my picture, get me balloons, let me wear a stupid little tiara and sing me happy birthday. 

It’s so stupid, I don’t NEED those things, I feel like a spoiled child but I just feel so alone. It made me burst out crying, and I can’t stop crying even writing this because I crave friendship but I don’t even know where to look anymore. And if someone were to come along and offer me their friendship, I wouldn’t even know what to do anymore. 

I feel so stupid. I have a loving boyfriend who would do anything for me and is my best friend but we see each other every day and sometimes you just need something a little different than the same person all the time. Sometimes I feel so selfish and needy for thinking that 😖

Tonight I broke. I can't deal with loneliness anymore.,618,False,"Hi Reddit, I hope you're being okay tonight. 

I'm not. I'm gonna sound really pessimistic, I apologize for that. I'm a very positive person. I always smile, I always try to cheer up everyone. Right now I'm doing everything I advice people not to do. 

I'm going through a rough patch, but I always keep people things will get better. I usually believe so. I try and keep busy, I don't want to let depression keep me down. But tonight I broke. Tonight I can't keep going. 

I'm a 24 going on 25 Female. I'm both extroverted and introverted. I love people and taking care of them. I love making people happy. I love my family and I spoil them everytime I can. I pay most stuff for them whenever it's possible. I just like it when people are happy. My life was doing okay until recently. Everything went downhill. My boyfriend cheated on me with a girl he left me for. His friends followed him because, well, they were his friends to begin with.

A while later, while coping with it, I found out my male best friend was jealous of him and had hacked into my laptop to spy on my conversations. He'd been doing so for a while, and never bothered to tell me. 

Then an old friend of mine, male also, told me he had to stop talking to me because he had a new girlfriend that was aware that he had feelings for me and asked him to choose between me and her. 

I graduated college a while after that, celebrated alone with my family and started job hunting. I still didn't find anything. I'm not doing anything all day. I live on the money I saved. I went back to my parents' house to live with them because well... I'd broken up with my bf. 

And yet I always remained optimistic, as much as possible. I didn't want to dwell on those thoughts but loneliness was really hard to cope with. I mediated, exercised, but at the end of the day I didn't have anyone to text or to hang out with, and I'm not the best at finding ways to find new ways of meeting people. I hope finding a job will help, but I can't find anything. Yet I keep smiling, everyday. People tell me I'm brave and strong, and I want to believe them. 

But I still cry. My heart feels empty. I'd like to believe I'm better off alone and that I don't need anyone but I do. I miss my friends, I'm sick of people leaving me. I hate spending this summer all alone. I'd love to solo travel, but I can't really afford it and to be honest, I'm a bit scared. I wouldn't know where to start, and how to organize a budget. 

Guys, I don't feel depressed because I want to die. I feel depressed because I want to live so much, and I feel like I'm cursed. Everytime I made a friend in my life, I lost them, and I'm all alone. I don't talk to anyone about my little obsessions, about my favorite movies. I tried turning to my family for that. My brother and I have always been really close and I've always had his back. Last year, I paid him his dream trip. Tonight, after a week of staying on his computer with his friends, he told me he cared more about them and his girlfriend than he did me. He told me that he knew it wasn't fair, but he wouldn't change. It felt so unfair. I always helped him, I was always there for him, and hearing him willingly turning his back on me felt like too much. 

So tonight, I broke. I just burst into tears. I feel so alone, and it feels really unfair. I try to bring positivity in my life everyday, I take care of the people I love. All I expect in return is respect and a bit of support. I don't know what to do. I'm sick of being alone. I'm sick of being abandoned by everyone, I'm sick of having to pick myself up every single time to end up being hurt more. I'm not as strong and positive as people think I am. I'm simply human, and tonight I can't pick myself up anymore. I desperately need a hug, or someone, or anything. I have nobody to call, nobody to turn to, and as much as I'd like to be independent, I'm not. I've always strived to be the best of friend, and I'm sad I don't have anyone to share this with. 

I miss my old life. I feel desperate tonight. I feel broken and hopeless. I feel so lonely. 
I feel so lonely. 
I'm sorry for being overdramatic. I know it's not the end of the world. But tonight, for me, it's too much to bear. It's late, but my face is all puffy and red and I can't stop crying. 

I'm sorry for writing so much. I really needed this off my chest, even if noone ever reads it. Maybe tomorrow I'll be back to my ""normal"" self. Tonight I just needed to say that I'm not okay and that I'm desperately lonely. Friendship is one of the best things in life, and I miss it terribly. I want to have people to go on adventures with, people I laugh to the point my stomach hurts, people whose shoulder I can cry on without fearing judgement, people that'll have my back as I'll have theirs. I just don't wanna be alone anymore. I've been alone for too long already. 

Thank you again. I'm sorry, I might have killed the mood tonight. 

Edit : I genuinely didn't expect this many reactions to my post. I woke up this morning feeling like my face had been hit by a truck from all the crying and I didn't think of checking reddit because I thought it'd sunken down in oblivion already. You guys definitely restored my faith in humanity and I wish I could all take you out to get whatever it is you love eating/drinking best. (If you guys ever are in Paris...) 

I'd never written something that desperate about myself, since I thought that burying the bad emotions within would eventually make them die out. I'm not 100% okay of course, but I think I'm ready to be back on track of the positivity path and I am so happy to read that my post helped some of you. You're all welcome in my inbox anytime, for anything. I'll be happy to reply.

",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6r10u7/tonight_i_broke_i_cant_deal_with_loneliness/,"Hi Reddit, I hope you're being okay tonight. 

I'm not. I'm gonna sound really pessimistic, I apologize for that. I'm a very positive person. I always smile, I always try to cheer up everyone. Right now I'm doing everything I advice people not to do. 

I'm going through a rough patch, but I always keep people things will get better. I usually believe so. I try and keep busy, I don't want to let depression keep me down. But tonight I broke. Tonight I can't keep going. 

I'm a 24 going on 25 Female. I'm both extroverted and introverted. I love people and taking care of them. I love making people happy. I love my family and I spoil them everytime I can. I pay most stuff for them whenever it's possible. I just like it when people are happy. My life was doing okay until recently. Everything went downhill. My boyfriend cheated on me with a girl he left me for. His friends followed him because, well, they were his friends to begin with.

A while later, while coping with it, I found out my male best friend was jealous of him and had hacked into my laptop to spy on my conversations. He'd been doing so for a while, and never bothered to tell me. 

Then an old friend of mine, male also, told me he had to stop talking to me because he had a new girlfriend that was aware that he had feelings for me and asked him to choose between me and her. 

I graduated college a while after that, celebrated alone with my family and started job hunting. I still didn't find anything. I'm not doing anything all day. I live on the money I saved. I went back to my parents' house to live with them because well... I'd broken up with my bf. 

And yet I always remained optimistic, as much as possible. I didn't want to dwell on those thoughts but loneliness was really hard to cope with. I mediated, exercised, but at the end of the day I didn't have anyone to text or to hang out with, and I'm not the best at finding ways to find new ways of meeting people. I hope finding a job will help, but I can't find anything. Yet I keep smiling, everyday. People tell me I'm brave and strong, and I want to believe them. 

But I still cry. My heart feels empty. I'd like to believe I'm better off alone and that I don't need anyone but I do. I miss my friends, I'm sick of people leaving me. I hate spending this summer all alone. I'd love to solo travel, but I can't really afford it and to be honest, I'm a bit scared. I wouldn't know where to start, and how to organize a budget. 

Guys, I don't feel depressed because I want to die. I feel depressed because I want to live so much, and I feel like I'm cursed. Everytime I made a friend in my life, I lost them, and I'm all alone. I don't talk to anyone about my little obsessions, about my favorite movies. I tried turning to my family for that. My brother and I have always been really close and I've always had his back. Last year, I paid him his dream trip. Tonight, after a week of staying on his computer with his friends, he told me he cared more about them and his girlfriend than he did me. He told me that he knew it wasn't fair, but he wouldn't change. It felt so unfair. I always helped him, I was always there for him, and hearing him willingly turning his back on me felt like too much. 

So tonight, I broke. I just burst into tears. I feel so alone, and it feels really unfair. I try to bring positivity in my life everyday, I take care of the people I love. All I expect in return is respect and a bit of support. I don't know what to do. I'm sick of being alone. I'm sick of being abandoned by everyone, I'm sick of having to pick myself up every single time to end up being hurt more. I'm not as strong and positive as people think I am. I'm simply human, and tonight I can't pick myself up anymore. I desperately need a hug, or someone, or anything. I have nobody to call, nobody to turn to, and as much as I'd like to be independent, I'm not. I've always strived to be the best of friend, and I'm sad I don't have anyone to share this with.

Edit: this might not belong here, but I'm not quite sure where to go

Edit 2: A little background of how this came about.

I was in a slump for a whole month recently, I stopped going to work, I stopped contacting my family and friends, I went in and out of hospitals for cutting myself. Since I live alone, and my nearest friend was almost an hour away, I avoided everyone in fear of burdening them to come and look for me. But few close friends still came over and helped me to get back to reality and helped me to manage myself again, and I'm slowly getting better now. During my slump a lot of my casual normal friends were asking and somehow accusing me of making excuses to just run away and avoid my responsibilities. So I came forward, texted the group chat and explain about whatever happened to me and what I felt. I mentioned that I wasn't expecting anyone to understand, I just wanted to explain myself so they would stop making accusations. Then a friend texted that to the group chat, and since last night the whole text was left at that. I didn't know what to respond, so I just went to sleep feeling blank and a bit lost. My close friends told me to just ignore because if the person don't want to be around, there are others who would be glad to help me as much as I need.

Somehow I'm kinda okay with it now, after reading all your comments. But I still wonder:

I think I'm reaching my breaking point.

About half a year ago I was doing okay. I lost so much in just three months I'm still stunned about it. First I got out of job, I will spare you the details. I thought I'd be okay, because I thought I could find something else soon enough. But then my dog got very ill. I stayed home to take care of him, but he died a few weeks later. I was completely heartbroken. He was my childhood dog, the one I grew up with, and since I had already lost another dog two years ago I was clinging onto him.

I miss him so much, but it didn't end here. Barely a week later, I'm having this huge fight with my male best friend (I'm a woman) because I found out he's been hacking into my computer and had access to all my personal info and more importantly my conversations. He confessed on spying on my conversations with my boyfriend and that he'd been doing so for six months because he was jealous of our relationship. I was heartbroken again because this guy had been my best friend for so long and I would have trusted him with my life so this definitely felt like betrayal. I decided not to talk to him anymore.

But as if it weren't enough yet, no later than a few weeks later, my boyfriend asks me if I would like ""opening our relationship"" cause you know, there's this girl that's really hot and funny and he'd love to bang her too. When I told him that it made me uncomfortable and that I thought polyamory wasn't my thing, he left me and now he's in a relationship with her. Since I was the one that joined his group of friends, obviously they kept hanging out with him.

I'm heartbroken. I'm lonely. I'm spending summer home cause well, the trip we wanted to make together was cancelled. I'm out of job, my best friend is dead, my other best friend is creepy and my previous boyfriend is a jerk. Obviously, I'm probably better off without people like that in my life, but loneliness is killing me. I never was the best at making new friends even though I love people and finally having some stability in my relationships was really refreshing for a chance.

But you have to get the materials, you have to make a plan. Even more difficult, you actually have to *do* it. And of course, you don't want to fuck it up, because things get even worse if you do.

"""Don't fool me. You don't have depression""",613,False,"This... thing...

A couple of hours ago i confided to my mom about my condition. Linking it to my tendency to hide details and lie to her and p much everyone else i deem mentally dangerous. What happened chilled me so hard, enough to have my tears stop from falling

It was a mild noon. I was cooped up with her in our bedroom (a family bedroom shared by everyone. It's a third world thing) and was on the verge of breaking apart. She had just learned of the debts I was trying to pay in secret without the knowledge of her or anyone within the household. I was trying to explain things but she wouldn't budge, uttering words like ""im disappointed in you"" again and again and again like a broken god damn record.

I had my last card. Tell her the truth, of what's going on. I gathered the courage to get up and tell her everything. ""Mom. I think i need professional help"". My voice quivered, tears started welling up. I knew i had to tell this sooner or later or it'll eat away at me like acid. ""Mom. please. I need help"" as i burst into tears. Imagine that... a 19 year old f***ing boy crying in front of his mother. Pathetic right?

That's exactly what she thought. She immediately told me to stop crying as she finds it p distasteful. I tried stopping the tears but to no avail. I told her everything. When it got to my suicide confession, what she said next just stopped me in my tracks.

""And?""

That's all she had said. She even refused to go near me during the whole ordeal, with an obvious look of disbelief, curiosity and mocking on her face. I continued to plea for help. Amusement replaced curiosity and soon enough she spoke the following words:

""You don't fool me. You don't have depression""

I stopped. I was horrified, disgusted, angry, and helpless. I thought she would understand what's what. Instead...

She blamed ME for being depressed. She told me i wasn't taking care of myself well enough and that I wasn't paying any shred of attention to whatever she says. I have, for the love of god, taken care of myself well enough to not have any minor AND major health problems. She refused to acknowledge that I have done everything by the god damn book, i am physically well, and its my mind that's breaking apart.

She then proceeded to tell me her story of how things werent all sunshines and rainbows back in her college days. Where she had no friends when she started and all that bullcrap. At the end of the day, I AM in the wrong.

Academics have played a huge part in my downward spiral. The pressure to graduate on time despite the subjects looking grimmer than ever has punched my soul hard to a pulp. I have yet to propose mom for a different approach to this spartan practice but i doubt it'll do anything significant, if it does anything at all...

I don't... know what to do. I don't want to bother my best friend with this no longer as she has a life to live, and her own problems to deal with. I don't want to burden anyone anymore. 

Help.... i'm seriously looking at the void as a better alternative than living through this hell for the next few years or so

I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding.,596,False,"Hi. 

I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down.

These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. 

The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help.

What I'm asking:

As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help.

They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year.

Thanks.

Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses.

I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction.

One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal.  Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. 

This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. 

I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch.

Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies.

It's been about three years since me and my ex fiancee broke up. I still think of her and her kids all the time. I found out yesterday that she died.,590,False,"I don't even know why I'm coming here and posting this.

Ever since the seventh grade, she was my only love. Even after we broke up, I only had one girlfriend and that didn't last too long. I could never get over her. When we broke up we didn't even talk hardly ever after a few months. 

I know that this story is all jumbled, and it will be. I don't think I could make any kind of comprehensible story right now.

God I remember everything. Every damn thing about her and that we ever did, over the past 8 years. Every. Single. Thing. 

From when I first laid eyes on her when she was my best friend's girlfriend, to the first time I went over to her house, to when she gave me my first kiss, when she moved away, when I was her support system, we were each other's only friends, when I'd stay up 8 hours a night to talk to her to keep her from committing suicide, when I found out she was pregnant with another man's child, when she was abandoned by her fiancee, when I told her I still loved her...

She was my first and only everything, and I treated her like my god. First kiss, girlfriend, first in bed, first time I felt loved, first time I could talk about my true feelings...my first time being a dad...

I remember talking to her mom and dad about marrying her. They told me they were so happy that I asked, that they always hoped for a man like me to come along. 

Her and I talked about how we wanted to get married all the time. It was going to be so perfect.

Until it wasn't. Life got in the way. We had both grown up so lonely, so abused, so broken. We didn't know how to love, how to act with those we were close to, because we were never close to anyone. 

She had postpartum. I was on some fucked up meds from destroying my back in an accident. We were both in school. We were kids, parents, students, lovers, and crazy in love. But when you have so many things pulling you apart, a slight tug is all it takes. Neither of us knew how to deal with emotions. I'd say it was like a fairy tail and things are all right, but after all those things, we ended up separating. We figured it would be best for the time. We told each other we were just going to finish school, and get steady jobs. We'd get back together, and would be a happy family once more.

Again, life isn't a fairytale. It didn't happen like that. It became a love-hate relationship. We got jealous and envious of each other, it drove us apart, and only made our love-hate relationship become more hate than love.

I feel like she hated me, and I ended up loving her. She ended up in another relationship, she got pregnant yet again, which truly ended things between us.

But I still loved her. I knew that the girl I once loved was no longer mine, and wouldn't be. It was too late. It was so hard to accept another man's child into my life, but he was without a dad and it reminded me of myself. After only a month or so, that kid meant more to me than anything in life.

I hadn't heard from her in a while. Probably a year, maybe even a little more. Yesterday, April 22nd 2019, I found out that she had died April 20th 2019. I found out today, April 23rd 2019, she was killed in a hit-and-run. I never get to tell her how much I loved her and that I was sorry for how things went. She'll never tell her kids how much she loved them. I'll never see any of them again. I knew things were over but it feels like I've lost them all over again. Her children are now orphans, and if I could I would absolutely adopt them both. I would have the kid I was there for the birth of, and raised as my own for years. And I would have I Second Son. I knew I couldn't though. Can't.

God I wish I could. I blame myself. I know people will say that I can blame if ands or buts all day, however I know for certain that she would still be alive and two beautiful children wouldn't be orphans right now if I had just done things differently. I'll never stop blaming myself. I never did stop blaming myself and I sure as hell won't now. I should have been the one to die out of both of us. I have nothing to live for. I work a shit job that is of no importance, I've been having trouble getting into school, I have no motivation, I've had one girlfriend besides her, I have two friends, one I don't even know in real life, the other I rarely see, and I don't have children.

I don't know how I'm supposed to live with this. I think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life however long it may be. I wish I could kill myself but I know I can't. The only things keeping me going are the hopes that I can have children one day, the fact that a small amount of people would be upset if I died, the feel that I need to live with this intense guilt and pain for the rest of my life, and the slight stupid childish glimmer of hope that I might be able to do something for that baby once more. Even if he's not a baby anymore.

I'm sorry for the rant, but it feels like it's physically destroying me holding it in. I just had to put it somewhere. I just can't hold it in. I never thought my pain could get worse but my God it got so much worse.

Edit: I've been thinking some more. Well, a lot more. Something small some things big. Like, before the baby was born, I was 350 pounds. I love that boy so much that I told myself that I was going to be healthy so I could play with him, be there for him, and so I wouldn't have so many health issues and end up dying too young and hurting him and his mom by doing so. Within a year I was 220. I went a little too far, so then I got back up to 250, but I've managed to stay in pretty good condition. All because of that little boy.

After my ex-fiancee's death, I've also had I guess kind of revelation of sorts. I realize that despite how much of a terrible, abuse filled life that I've had, pushing people away and not making friends has just made it worse. I hope I don't end up forgetting about this or not feeling this in my coming weeks, months, or even years, but I don't want to be antisocial anymore. I want to actually know the feeling to have multiple friends, to have somebody who loves you and who you love back once more. Once I get that love, I don't want to ever let things just happen, I want to be able to actually articulate my emotions, and communicate. I know you can't control when the past gets to you, but I'm going to try my hardest from this point on to not let the past get to me any more than it has. The pain of this event will never go away, and as I always have, since the second I saw her eyes in seventh grade, I will always love her. Even if towards the end she was pretty much indifferent to me. This may be the most pain, or maybe second most pain I've ever had in my life behind her leaving me, but I don't want to find somebody a year down the road and let this not let me be happy.

Wish me luck, and thank you all for the kind words, it truely does make a difference. When you feel you are drowning, even having a single hand reach out to you can make a difference, let alone so many hands reaching out at once.

I stopped seeing doctor and taking medicines because my brother and sister laughed at me and called me “crazy”. My mother tells all her friends and our relatives that I’m useless and lazy.

I started babbling and she interrupted me and said “ma’am are you going to hurt yourself or not”

Me: umm...

Her: if you are, you can go to a crisis center. There’s one at so and so hospital.

Me: umm I don’t have insurance.

Her: well you can just pay

Me: I... don’t know if I want to go there

Her: .... so are you trying to harm yourself or *not*?

At that point I just hung up. She was making my anxiety worse.  

So I called the depression hotline. The man who answered was very kind and gentle, listened to me cry, comforted me, and gave me advice on what to do next time I was feeling like this.

"after almost canceling an interview today due to anxiety, I forced myself to go, went in there, and killed it!!!!!",1471,False,"I was SO nervous all last night and all day today about this interview. Interviews are a MAJOR trigger for me, I almost always have an anxiety attack in the middle of them, and I’m really not very good at them. On top of that, it was for a bilingual role and I knew I’d have to speak German and I was so insecure about my fluency and so freaking anxious that I would totally bomb and embarrass myself. 

I was SO close to canceling. I made a million excuses to my friends in family about why I didn’t really want the job anyway so I might as well not go. I am so, so glad I didn’t. 

I experienced a bit of anxiety, but no attacks! I wasn’t stammering and awkward like I usually am and I was really confident in all of my answers. Best of all, when they brought in the German dude so I could converse with him, he said it was really good and my pronunciation was great, and after he left they all said he’s Never been impressed by anyone’s German before!!!

I never feel good or confident after leaving an interview, but this time I do. I Really Really Really hope I get the job (the office is UNREAL, benefits are wild, free breakfast and lunch, everyone was super laid back, better pay) but even if I don’t, I’m just so damn proud of myself for forcing myself to go instead of bailing like I always do.

Just had to share because I feel super happy right now. :) wish me luck!

My best friend became a mass murderer. I’ve never been the same since that day.,1354,False,"So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It’s been several years, about 6, and while I’ll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I’m just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn’t help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I’m pretty sure he either didn’t want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn’t even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn’t do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn’t realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he’d try to change the subject. Don’t get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn’t even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn’t feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like “oh let’s smoke a bowl that’ll cheer you up!” And that was when I had my first panic attack. I’m talking full on “I’m gonna die oh my god.” This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn’t sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn’t know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I’ve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it’s caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can’t really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don’t really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he’s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I’m kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It’s hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can’t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I’d love to answer, but I’d also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I’m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don’t deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that’s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a “haha I got you” thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I’m trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven’t responded yet, I will definitely try. I’ll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously.

I’m talking full on “I’m gonna die oh my god.” This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn’t sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn’t know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I’ve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it’s caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can’t really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don’t really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he’s never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I’m kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It’s hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can’t focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I’d love to answer, but I’d also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I’m in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don’t deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that’s stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a “haha I got you” thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I’m trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven’t responded yet, I will definitely try. I’ll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously. ",9nmosq,Anxiety,136

"Does anyone else constantly feel like the ""pity friend"" and like everyone you know is closer to each other than to you?",1330,False,"This is one of the core issues of my social anxiety. I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups.

"This time last year I couldn’t leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.",1331,False,"I’m a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn’t drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn’t leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it’s just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn’t the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who’s notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can’t touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do.

I thought my fear of talking to other people and my fear of making phone calls (often to the point of tears) was just me being shy. I thought constant chest tightness and pain was just normal stress. I thought it was normal for the smallest things to be beyond overwhelming. My intense fears of constantly fucking up had been with me for so long that I never thought twice about the rationale behind it. I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual. That happened out of nowhere, then an unexpected loss in the family sent me over the edge in terms of panicking. It dawned on me after the worst had passed that maybe this is an anxiety disorder. I did a lot of self-reflecting and realized maybe I've been anxious all my life and I Just never realized it because I thought it was normal.

1. I went completely caffeine free. It's been about a month. I also was having headaches and issues with my blood pressure, both of which are better. I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful.

"I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever.",1065,False,"I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes — whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology — it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion — something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: ""Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.""

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer — often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom — it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, ""You're doing great!""), and it automatically calls the next representative.

-----

At the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.

Long story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.

P.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.

**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality. Turned out to be the easiest thing ever, and made me feel like I made a huge accomplishment regarding my condition. It also means I actually did something that allowed me to voice my opinion, which made me feel good.",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7ern0j/i_decided_to_fight_for_net_neutrality_even_with/,"I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes — whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology — it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion — something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: ""Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.""

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer — often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom — it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, ""You're doing great!""), and it automatically calls the next representative.

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say “fuck it”, the better I feel.
* It’s just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What’s the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don’t focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don’t have to do anything.
* It’s not what I have to do. It’s what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that’s because that’s what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn’t going anywhere.
* Don’t be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn’t be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don’t have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there’s nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept the anxiety. Don’t try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don’t try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You’ll see that you’ll calm down soon.
* Expect the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don’t focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

&#x200B;

**Other**

* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.

- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber

- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you’re not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it’s a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It’s easy for us to fall in the trap of “freezing” and never do the things that we *know* calm us down.

Guys—for the first time in my life I stopped a panic attack before it started.,947,False,"I felt my panic attack coming on while on my way to a talk at a recent conference I attended. It always starts with vertigo for me, and quickly leads into feelings of fear, claustrophobia, and the inability to catch my breath. Usually, the second I feel that dizziness hit I know there’s no stopping the panic attack that follows it. I hole up in the nearest bathroom stall and resign myself to riding it out, a process that can take hours and often results in DAYS of constant vertigo afterwards.

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I’m so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you’ve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this!

I felt it coming on as I was headed to the talk, but it was a talk I was really interested in so I was like “oh no you don’t!” I focused my mind on some mindfulness techniques i learned in therapy—namely, the technique of observing my surroundings closely and mentally taking note of them (there is a red backpack in the corner, the man next to me is wearing black shoes, one of his shoelaces is untied, the room smells a little bit like sweat, etc) and GUESS WHAT. For the first time EVER, without medication, I got the panic attack under control. And I was able to enjoy the talk and get a lot out of it!

I’m so proud of myself, you guys. I had to share because I want you all to know that even if you’ve been struggling for years, there ARE mental techniques that can help keep panic attacks from hitting. We can do this! We don’t have to be anxiety’s bitch! And that’s the best feeling in the entire world.",8xlqik,Anxiety,323

"The ""crazy bitch box"" concept",948,False,"I have a co-worker who knows exactly how to spike my anxiety and those of others in the office.  This is the person who CCs your boss if there's a typo in a \*draft\* document you create (complete with screenshots and red circles), who reports you to the boss if you're 5 minutes late to do a task for her or don't do it fast enough, and who will get in your face and yell at you if you DARE question her.  All in all, a peach to work with. My boss is aware of these issues but he gets the same treatment from her, and at this point has all her daily e-mails (30+) re-routed to spam.

She was in a mood this morning and we had to interact. Cue a 45 minute yelling fit because I dared ask her a scheduling question and because of her 45 minute rant, everything was late, which led to more yelling.  Normally, this gets me very anxious as yelling is a big trigger for me. My anxiety is deeply rooted in my penchant for perfectionism and wanting validation from others. So, I would normally be a mess after this interaction.

But, last week, my therapist introduced me to what she called the ""crazy bitch box"" theory.  When my coworker starts ranting/yelling, I simply imagine placing her in a soundproof box and shutting the door.  This soundproof box is the ""crazy bitch box"" and she stays there. She can rant all she wants while she is in the box, and the box contains her so what she says/does can't hurt me.  By having that visualization, my anxiety about interacting with her is minimized.  85% of what she says gets her placed in the ""crazy bitch box"" and I'm so much calmer because somehow with her in the box, I feel safer.  Plus, the idea of someone stuck in a tiny Plexiglas box makes me giggle.

Hoping this concept might help someone here.

"Three years ago I was too afraid to leave my house or look out windows, I hid my anxiety with daily binge drinking and dropped out of college. Yesterday my partner had to leave unexpectedly during a vacation for a work emergency, and I travelled the south coast of Iceland all by myself!",944,False,"Hello all—

I wanted to share some details from my journey with mental illness and progress.

I am 22F. I have had troubles with substance abuse, anxiety, depression, behavior comparable to cluster b personality disorders, and severe depersonalization-derealization symptoms for quite some time. I’m a massive hypochondriac and have a horrible fear of flying and being alone.

A few years ago, when I was at my worst, I was using drugs and dropped out of community college twice because I was too afraid to leave my house. I lived with a guy who was really bad for me and who I was very terrible to, and gained 20 pounds in a year. I remember being so severely anxious and depressed that I had to start doing therapy over the phone because I didn’t want to go out to see my therapist, and if I went outside (something I only did to smoke cigarettes) I couldn’t look out at the trees or up at the sky because everything was so overwhelming. I thought I’d never get better, I thought things would only get worse tbh.

Fast forward over the next year, the boyfriend ends up moving out and we have a very dramatic breakup. I begin to have to force myself to drive to run errands, and I grow so lonely that I decide to start seeing friends again—they were so welcoming. Over the next few months, I started to pick up the pieces. I moved closer to a city to go to massage school, I got a job, I started dating, got on a plane for my birthday, supported my family through my grandfather’s palliative care. 

Then I finished massage school, which was a huge triumph for me. I moved to DC, and got my dream job. I met an amazing man and started a new, better relationship. I stopped using drugs, I switched to a significantly better therapist. Tried psychiatrists as well, but ended up not going that route. My boyfriend became my husband when he needed to move to the Middle East for a job and I decided I’d go with him for some time to enroll in esthetician school there. We moved to Qatar, I picked up exercising and meal prep and ended up at my lowest weight as an adult. I’ve been writing and reading more. I’m back in school, adding modalities to my work. Still seeing my therapist via teletherapy. Since I moved in August I’ve managed to get on 11 planes and will fly again tonight, though it is still very scary for me I know I can do it. I’ve travelled 7 new countries that I’d never thought I’d see, and truly enjoyed it. 

That said, I still have my struggles. I believe I always will; however, the difference in the quality of my life is remarkable. I still have panic attacks sometimes, I still go through extremely obsessive-compulsive behavior and hypochondriasis, I still have DPDR episodes, and I still struggle with impulsive behavior and the relationships in my life—but everything is not so severe as it was. 

Yesterday was a new milestone for me and I’m super stoked about it. My husband and I, on vacation in Iceland, received news that he had to leave immediately for work. We’d already paid for two flights and accommodations for another day in Iceland, then 2 days in London, so we decided it’d be best if I took the trip myself. I was TERRIFIED. I’ve never travelled alone internationally, and the last time I flew alone was 4 years ago—which was my worst panic attack on a plane. But I decided to try anyways, and I’ve surprised myself so far. Yesterday I woke up alone, drove [5 hours away from my hotel to sightsee](https://imgur.com/gallery/4YwRY43), even through some scary weather, and even did a 2 mile hike alone. I loved it! I can’t believe what a great time I had! 

I am sitting in a cafe now writing this to you all because I feel so grateful for the departure I’ve taken from the life I used to live, and how much less my life is dominated by the limitations of my mental illness. Also—I haven’t had a cigarette in a week! Tonight I will fly alone for the first time in a long time, and I’m terrified, but I know I can do it.

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well.

I have been deep in depression and anxiety for about 6 months. I went to the dentist in May due to an emergency.

She urged everyone that electric toothbrushes are the best way to clean up dental health quickly.

Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,909,False,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time. I'm currently doing a summer internship and mentally noted a few ""productive"" things I wanted to do in my freetime (such as reading books or learning HTML/CSS or working out). However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

I think this is related to a fear that's often at the back of my mind - of aging and not doing anything important with my life. I place too much importance on developing new skills so then I'm scared of failure and am too anxious to do anything.

A cool anxiety technique I learned,908,False,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible!

Do any of you HATE loud sounds?,857,False,"Having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise. Even if it's a noise I'm anticipating, like the fire alarm in a building being tested, or an alarm clock ringing, the anticipation only makes me more nervous about hearing the sound. I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one. In my mind there's nothing worse than the sound of a balloon bursting. Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous.

And then once I started gaining just a little bit of confidence, I pushed myself to make calls to other people. Sure I had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so I could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. I started making calls. From booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, I did it, and the pride I felt every time after the call was unexplainable. I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could’ve said better, the ways I could’ve changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn’t write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I’m hopeful it goes well.

Does anyone else feel completely disconnected from who they used to be?,823,False,"I’ve been experiencing the beginnings of an attack for the past hour or so and all I can think of is that I’m not “me” anymore. Like I’ve left home before I was ready. I keep remembering that I used to like playing music in bands, I used to like to have fun with friends, I used to have hope and make plans, I used to laugh and joke a lot...

I used to be someone else. 

Now, Im somewhere else and I feel like an empty vessel who’s only purpose is to dwell on what used to be, but seemingly can never be again. Nothing seems to matter, and simultaneously, nothing makes any sense. 

It’s so hard to put into words how I’m feeling. It’s like... everything is blank. Empty. And nothing feels real at all. Like, I’m living someone else’s life. And what I do, what I say, what I feel- is irrelevant and pointless. I just want to go home and be who I used to be. But I know I can’t. That person is forever gone. Changed by this disgusting horror that’s consumed me. 

And finding out the cause of this is impossible. There’s no trigger. There’s not single thing that starts it, because it’s a constant. It doesn’t ever stop. I’m currently seeing two therapists, and on two meds, (anxiety and depression) and I think I’m getting worse by the day. It’s like- every day I lose more of me- in the process of becoming something else. I just want it all to stop. 

I miss me so much.

I kind of feel like that little bumble bee in the No Rain video by Blind Melon. I’ve found my people!

# Anxiety tip #1 -  Stop consuming caffeine

Caffeine increases the level of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine in your brain. This neurotransmitter triggers your sympathetic nervous system. Stimulating your fight or flight response is the primary process of the sympathetic nervous system. 

Caffeine also makes your body release adrenaline and depletes your body of the ‘anti-stress vitamin’ B1 (thiamine). For anxious people these things add up quickly, making them feel stressed out and on edge. 

Note: The sensitivity to caffeine varies quite a bit between people. But whether you are sensitive to caffeine or not, **caffeine WILL make you feel more anxious**. It’s best to avoid caffeine as much as you can. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #2 - Set specific times in your day to be offline

People with anxiety are usually sensitive and easily overstimulated. We might have gotten used to it, but the internet is a pretty hectic place. Your subconsciousness knows that at any time it could see something on the internet that will trigger it. You won't get really deep rest and stress relief if you are always online

**It’s very important that you create time for yourself every day where you KNOW that you won’t be disturbed**. Most people don’t recover well enough from their daily stress. That’s why our stress accumulates and we end up feeling anxious and on edge more than we need too. We can make sure this stops happening by planning time into our day where we’ll be offline. We should put our phone away and go read a book, meditate, or go for a walk everyday. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #3 - Train yourself to breathe through your stomach

Scientists have recently discovered that humans have group of brain cells whose only function it is to ‘watch’ our breath. If the breath is slow, deep, and done with our stomach, it signals to the brain that everything is okay. If the breath is fast, shallow, and done with our chest, it signals to the brain that something might be off.

Breathing in your chest is meant for fight or flight situations. It’s original purpose is to get your body and your mind in a state of readiness by pumping a ton of oxygen into them. 

**Breathing through your stomach has been proven to lower stress and anxiety**. And it’s actually not that hard to retrain yourself to breath like this all the time! If you learn to breathe through your stomach, you will be decreasing your anxiety automatically, just by breathing. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #4 - Tie up loose ends

You could do this right now, and it would make a world of difference. We can feel very overwhelmed and anxious because we have so many loose ends in our life. We have mail that we haven’t opened yet, we have friends we should call, maybe our room needs a good cleaning, or you haven’t checked your bank statements in 2 months. 

These things are tricky to actually go and do. The longer we procrastinate, the more anxiety we build up around them. But biting the bullet and doing all these things will reduce your anxiety a lot. It might spike your anxiety while you’re doing it. But when it’s done you’ll feel much better and lighter. **The less we have on our mind, the less anxious we’ll feel.** 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #5 - Exercise at least twice a week

Now most of us know that exercise is healthy and works well to reduce anxiety. But a lot of us don’t realise just how critical exercise is. In his ‘*Anxiety and Phobia workbook*’  E.J. Bourne says **his clients reported exercise to be the most effective thing for reducing their anxiety.** 

Exercise is a natural outlet for the body's fight or flight mode. There are many proven benefits to regular exercise. Among them are reduced insomnia, increased self-esteem, and greater sense of control over anxiety. 

Pro Tip: Exercise that targets your larger muscles, like running, swimming, and cycling, are found to be the most effective for countering anxiety

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #6 - Be in flow

Athletes call this state ‘being in the zone’, Psychologists refer to it as flow. It’s a state where you forget the time and whatever is going on around you. If you are in flow you are totally absorbed in what you are doing. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who came up with the concept, describes the 8 characteristics of flow as follows:

1. Complete **concentration** on the task
2. **Clarity of goals** and reward in mind and immediate feedback
3. Transformation of **time** (speeding up/slowing down of time)
4. The experience is intrinsically **rewarding**
5. **Effortlessness** and ease
6. There is a balance between **challenge and skills**
7. Actions and awareness are merged, **losing self-conscious rumination**
8. There is a feeling of **control** over the task

Flow makes you temporarily free from your anxiety in a healthy way. It makes you more calm throughout your day and gives you something to look forward too. Find something that puts you in a state of flow and make sure you do it at least once or twice a week. It will make a big difference in in your life satisfaction.

# Anxiety tip #7 - create an anxiety busting morning ritual

Most people grab their phone the second they wake up. This is about worst thing you can do to start your day. It’s very important we start our day on our own terms.

But I did it. I fucking did it. I was in the busiest, loudest, most faced pased city in America. I had to ride the subway packed full of hundreds of people. I had to interact with producers and directors. I had deadlines.

I used to love reading, playing ukulele, drawing, playing video games. Now I get a huge feeling of anxiety creep over me when I try to get back into them.

 I think its a confidence issue? Like not feeling good enough at playing the ukulele, or not being good enough at drawing or playing games. I went to a private school where competitiveness was drummed into us. I was considered dumb because I didn’t get A* in everything and I really tied my self-worth to my abilities academically. 

Now I feel like my self-worth is tied to my pastimes. They’re meant to be the things that make me interesting as a person, I should be good at them and see progress in them. Am I even the person I think I am now that I’m too anxious to do any of these things? 

Another issue is feeling anxious that I’m possibly wasting time. I used to love sitting playing games for hours but now I feel this weight on my shoulder and pain in my chest. I feel like I should be doing something more proactive, even if I have nothing else I really need to be doing.

This is an odd question that has plagued me off and on for a few years..... I am posting here since my anxiety has been my most dominant mental health issue in the last few years. 

Also because I think this is actually a pretty big problem (for me at least). It only breeds more hate in my heart which I don’t need when I’m already juggling so many things. 
A lot of times I find myself so shaken when I see other people, especially people I might’ve gone to high school with for instance, doing so well mentally. They are able to handle so much more (perhaps they take more college classes, work more than me; etc) and still maintain a happy and overall positive attitude. Meanwhile I struggle to get out of bed most mornings and am trying to keep up my motivation enough so I don’t drop out of school again.

I hope this doesn’t come off as a “woe is me” post. I realize what my problems are and also realize I am the only one who can help them. I just want to start an open discussion to see if anyone else feels the same envy and jealously I feel sometimes when I see other people who are doing well in regards to their mental health, despite all the hardships in life.

I’m back at home and don’t want to go out again and will probably get into bed again and I still feel awful. But I have oranges now.

From what I’ve read, it’s a positive feedback loop, doing one tiny thing gives you a dopamine boost, which is the motivation neurotransmitter, this then makes you feel more able to do another small thing, and so you build up and eventually hopefully can do more.

Currently experiencing my anxiety nightmare. Reported sexual harassment at work and have a meeting with HR and the CEO in an hour. Willing myself not to puke.,724,False,"Long story, but over a couple months, one of my bosses had been sexually harassing me. I kept trying to brush it off, but I didn't know how to stop it and it was making me extremely uncomfortable being around him. I had worked for this person for two years without incident, and he knows about my anxiety, need to please others, and my conflict avoidance. Literally one of my weaknesses in my performance evaluation is ""trouble saying no to people"". I am also half his age and he is many levels above me in the company. I was the perfect target. I finally confided in my supervisor, who gave me the courage to step forward. 
I wrote out a log of days and times and what occured, which was a good idea timeline-wise, but also kept me from having to repeat out loud what was said and done to me when I went to HR. HR was very professional and took it seriously, telling me it wasn't my fault and they were glad I came forward.
My harasser is on unpaid suspension while they conduct an investigation, interviewing others in his department to see if anyone else has observed anything else. 

I have a meeting with HR, the CEO, and the VP in an hour and I can't stop panicking. I don't know what they will ask me. And I am completely mortified that they all know what I let happen. I also feel intense guilt for ruining his career. He was the face to many of our projects, and I'm throwing such a wrench into it. I really trusted him, so when this all started, I had no idea what to do.

I kept trying to brush it off, but I didn't know how to stop it and it was making me extremely uncomfortable being around him. I had worked for this person for two years without incident, and he knows about my anxiety, need to please others, and my conflict avoidance. Literally one of my weaknesses in my performance evaluation is ""trouble saying no to people"". I am also half his age and he is many levels above me in the company. I was the perfect target. I finally confided in my supervisor, who gave me the courage to step forward. 
I wrote out a log of days and times and what occured, which was a good idea timeline-wise, but also kept me from having to repeat out loud what was said and done to me when I went to HR. HR was very professional and took it seriously, telling me it wasn't my fault and they were glad I came forward.
My harasser is on unpaid suspension while they conduct an investigation, interviewing others in his department to see if anyone else has observed anything else. 

I have a meeting with HR, the CEO, and the VP in an hour and I can't stop panicking. I don't know what they will ask me. And I am completely mortified that they all know what I let happen. I also feel intense guilt for ruining his career. He was the face to many of our projects, and I'm throwing such a wrench into it. I really trusted him, so when this all started, I had no idea what to do.

-	Panic attacks / anxiety means cortisol levels are high
-	It's next to impossible to think happy thoughts when there’s cortisol everywhere
-	It's just the chemical making you feel this way, this is not you
-	If you start feeling anxious, just try to lower the cortisol levels; breath, ground yourself, feet on the floor, mindfulness
-	These are just thoughts, they aren’t as bad as they seem – it doesn’t seem true right now but you must believe it
-	Be aware and let them happen, don’t fight it
-	You can get through this, you have before
-	Just ride it out
-	Resist the temptation to let the anxiety take over – you do not want to feel this way
-	If you just want an excuse to relax/procrastinate you can do that without anxiety
-	If you refuse to believe that when you’re happy you’re not just faking it, then at least accept that it's nicer like that anyway as you dont have frequent panic attacks
-	Fuck the cortisol

I have a job interview for a promotion today!,713,False,"Send good vibes my way please! ☺️😊😁

Update: thank you so much everyone for the positive messages! I walked in feeling super confident, but.... 

I did not get the job. It turns out that I was vastly unprepared for the interview and I had no idea. The interviewer (internal promotion) explained to me that other applicants had gone to the location of the available job (store site) and spoke with different employees they would be working with, requested detailed financial statements and wrote up 90 day day-by-day plans for the store. 

Looking back now it seems obvious, but having been a temporary employee of that store when they were short staffed I figured I already had an insight to it and the day to day operations. I had asked a senior employee who has had the position I was interviewing for what I needed to do to prepare and he never mentioned any of these things. I know he didn’t do it maliciously, he’s a very scatterbrained person and was hand picked for the roll rather than going though the application process. 

Lucky for me my company wants employees who are eager to grow. The interview turned into a discussion about my current location and what is expected of me the next time I apply for a promotion. 

I was terrified that  I would make a catastrophic mistake during my interview and I did. While being so worried about my future with the company and being black listed if I messed up I had forgotten that the interviewers and managers are good and honest people who want to help their employees grow and succeed. Even if we do fail, sometimes there’s a hand ready to help us back up.

"Deactivated fb, it was damaging me mentally. No one has even noticed!",700,False,"Last Saturday morning, I deactivated fb (with a view to letting it delete after however long it takes). I found that despite 400+ 'friends', I actually wasn't enjoying it at all anymore. I know it's a cliché, and not real at all, but seeing people live their seemingly perfect lives, going out together, watching the little cliques develop and feeling increasingly left out, I decided enough was enough. It's not helping my mental health in the slightest. It has to go.

It is, admittedly, somewhat cathartic and liberating to no longer be a part of that social media network. I still have the ability to use messenger, so can still talk to people. But I think what's hurt a little more is literally only one person has noticed I'm no longer active on there. Which I suppose really hits home how insignificant my online presence was.

I feel very lonely. Friends that used to message me daily no longer message at all, and if I message them, it just gets left on 'read'. There are only so many times I can try, before I stop because clearly they won't respond.

There were so many of those friends that consistently would post / share memes etc about depression, anxiety; suicide. About how much they care and how we should all reach out if we haven't heard from someone in a while. The irony is, no one has. And despite not wanting to believe it, I don't think anyone will.

I work, I go home, walk / feed / play with my dog, then go to bed. I'm usually in bed by 8.30pm (up at 6am) because there seems little to stay awake for anymore.

I've posted on here once or twice, yo other subreddits, but never to this depth of revealing my feelings. I honestly don't mind if no one resounds, it's just useful for me to get this out of me.

But I think what's hurt a little more is literally only one person has noticed I'm no longer active on there. Which I suppose really hits home how insignificant my online presence was.

I feel very lonely. Friends that used to message me daily no longer message at all, and if I message them, it just gets left on 'read'. There are only so many times I can try, before I stop because clearly they won't respond.

There were so many of those friends that consistently would post / share memes etc about depression, anxiety; suicide. About how much they care and how we should all reach out if we haven't heard from someone in a while. The irony is, no one has. And despite not wanting to believe it, I don't think anyone will.

I work, I go home, walk / feed / play with my dog, then go to bed. I'm usually in bed by 8.30pm (up at 6am) because there seems little to stay awake for anymore.

I've posted on here once or twice, yo other subreddits, but never to this depth of revealing my feelings. I honestly don't mind if no one resounds, it's just useful for me to get this out of me.

I hate feeling sorry for myself, and I hate burdening people, even strangers - so anyone that reads this! with my ridiculous insignificant problems.

I'm just so very lonely. I'm sorry. ",a7az4h,Anxiety,565
What people think is a cure for anxiety is actually one of its causes.,700,False,"When I am feeling anxious and am searching the internet for advice I often come across some form of this:

""Understand that your anxiety is illogical and that you aren't actually in danger""

Suggesting that if you realize this, the anxiety will go away. In my experience it is the exact opposite. Just feeling anxious is one thing. I've felt anxious before big events, it's not pleasant, but if I don't fight it, it comes and goes and I move on. But feeling anxious and knowing you shouldn't be is where the problems really start. When I am anxious and know I shouldn't be, I worry that something is wrong with me and that adds to my anxiety. I can stay like this for weeks or months and I only seem to be able to break the cycle when something especially good happens and I get distracted enough to stop rejecting how I am feeling.

In the last year I have had considerable success overcoming anxiety by accepting it when it comes. This is way harder than it sounds. It's like flexing a muscle you didn't know you had. When I start feeling anxious, I make the conscious effort to accept how I'm feeling. I can't pull it off all the time, but I'm getting better and better at it. The trick is that you have to really believe it. You have to decide that how you are feeling is completely acceptable. You can't trick yourself and ""accept"" your anxiety in the hope that it will go away. You have to really be OK with it sticking around, and just like that it will be gone. It will come back, but you will be building up a skill that will allow you to once again let it pass.

My therapist of 4 years just passed away... I want to celebrate him. He helped me through my worst years.,693,False,"This isn't a post about being anxious due to my clinical psychologist dying. It is a celebration of what he meant to me and a celebration of all the therapist out there that are making a difference. 

My therapist's name was Louis. When I met him, nearly 4 years ago, I was at a bad place in my life. I had been suffering from the effects of Anxiety Disorder for nearly 13 years, and visiting my GP monthly for over a year, when I asked her for a recommendation for a therapist. She gave me Louis' number and the number of 3 other therapists.

After delaying for weeks, I called all of the referrals I was given. Two weren't taking new patients, one wasn't returning my calls and the 4th was Louis. What are the chances that I would like the only Therapist that would see me? (well, 100%)

I was really nervous about meeting Louis because I had never been to therapy before. I had no idea what to expect. Would he judge me? Would he yell at me? Would he humiliate me? Would he intimidate me into taking action? I wasn't sure, but decided that I was willing to try.

Louis was a short Jewish man that reminded me of the actor Saul Rubinek (Warehouse 13) with a trendier, gray, beard. He had a very soft way of communicating that made you feel instantly comfortable. After meeting him once, I knew that we were going to get along. Sometimes in life, you just click with people instantly. This is how it was with Louis and me. :)

As I went to each session, I discovered that Louis and I had tons in common: we experienced many of the same issues. So his recommendations felt tailored to me. In a way, talking to Louis was like talking to an older version of myself. We had different upbringings, I was raised Catholic and he was raised Jewish, but there we so many parallels between our lives that he would instantly be able to tell me his version of my story and how he dealt with it. This was the reinforcement I needed to prove to myself that everything was going to be okay. I was in good hands.

Don't get me wrong, not every session in 4 years was pleasant. But every session was productive. He knew how to see past my BS. He knew how to get to the core of the issue. And the amazing thing was that the days that I thought I had nothing to talk about were the days that we made the most progress.

Basically, when you don't think you have anything to talk about, it's usually because you have been trained to see past your BS. This means that you can actually start making some significant forward movements. 

Now, after 4 years of treatment. I am feeling fantastic and it is thanks to Louis. My goal when I started therapy was as follows:

To be myself without reservation, without shame, and without apology. 

Louis helped me to do these things by supporting the work I did as a vlogger. He helped me to talk publically about dealing with anxiety. He helped me to turn my weakness into a super power.

Now...

Today, while on a hike, I found out that Louis had passed away via the internet. I hadn't heard from him in few weeks and decided to give his office call. His message had been replaced with a referral service. I instantly typed ""Obituary Louis..."" and discovered that he had passed away 3 days ago, and I had just missed his funeral earlier in the day. 

The feelings came rushing in, but there was no Anxiety. It was just a combination of sadness and joy. As I walked through the park, I cried and laughed - I must have looked like a crazy person. 

I cried because I lost a great friend. I laughed because I was full of joyful gratitude. He saved my life. And, to me, gratitude is displayed as laughter with tears.

I decided that, while I missed his funeral, that I would place flowers at his office door. His office was right next door to a supermarket; so I ran in and got some flowers and a card. I quickly returned to my car and added the line... ""Louis was a blessing in my life.""

I exit my car and head towards the building only to be accosted by a parking attendant for the supermarket, ""You can't park here..."". I turn with flowers in hand, ""My friend is dead, I just want to show him some respect."" 

We argued a little and I told the attendant, in a frustrated tone, ""Fine! I will move my car!"" I could tell that he was kind of regretting telling me to move the car, due to the circumstances, but I just didn't have the time or energy.

I ran up the stairs to Louis' office, placed the flowers and the card at the door, and returned to my car. All I could think of is that Louis would have wanted me to apologize to the parking attendant. 

I drove toward the attendant... He looked me in the eye as I approached. Probably thinking I was going to flip him off or something. But I channelled my friend and said, ""I want to apologize. I was a jerk to you. My friend died and I am a little upset. But he trained me to see when I am spreading my pain around. You were just doing your job."" 

The attendant told me, ""I am feeling really bad about this..."" I told him ""I am sorry for making you feel bad, but I am grateful to you because you have helped me to see that the lessons, that my friend taught me, will always be with me. 

Louis will always be with me, as my shoulder angel.

People wishing to get validation from others (karma, gold, upvotes, etc.) Trolls, negativity, people fighting for the top comment or post.
Before I even wrote this I researched and found several older /r/Anxiety posts about the same topic, and even a whole article describing how I felt.

Even though I tell myself that I don't care about validation from others, that I don't care about what others think or being judged, I still get anxiety. In the back of my mind, I still have fear that whatever I have to say or do is not worth expressing. That someone has said it before, or that its unoriginal, or that it simply isn't good enough. That all of my thoughts are invalid. And because of that I shouldn't even try. Better nothing than a negative outcome.

On top of subconsciously fearing others, I fear myself. That whatever I have to say will never be perfect enough or amount to enough. That my high expectations will never be met anyway so why even try.
All throughout my school life, I have also struggled to complete anything (anything that involves writing or artistic projects) because of anxiety. It was either 100% or 0%. Which was not a healthy way of doing anything.  This post in itself is being written and re-written for weeks now.

But at the moment, I am writing this post to try to battle those thoughts in my head. Something, anything, is better than nothing. This post is to tell my anxiety that it doesn't matter who reads this post or how I write it, just the fact that I did it. That it doesn't matter if what I write or do is perfect, or the best or the worst, or way too long, but that it exists. And that my thoughts are valid because they exist. 
As long as am I alive, I am going to keep trying to find the courage to express myself and allow those thoughts to exist. Reddit is just one small way of doing so.

I made a small accomplishment today! I managed to go to the gym alone.,682,False,"After months of being stuck in a loop of staying indoors and not stepping outside my comfort zone, I decided that I needed to challenge myself and do something that I haven’t done before. 

Usually I go to the gym with my boyfriend, but even then, it has to be on a day when it is quiet, otherwise I feel overwhelmed. 

I had gotten kinda out of shape as I haven’t been to the gym now for around 3 months. 

Honestly, I’ve been starting to get super negative thoughts about the way I look so I really wanted to change that before it gets worse. For me, working out is one of the few things that I actually enjoy doing! A bonus is that it helps me sleep like a rock. 

I kept telling myself that the worst that could happen would be if I get something wrong, and people stare at me- but so what? No one really cares about what others do in the gym. 

With this in mind, I managed a great workout session and I plan to keep it up. I feel amazing! 

Taking small steps and even having the intention of doing something new is a good step to take.  I hope you guys work towards doing something new today. ☺️

Be aware of your distorted thinking,678,False,"In general, there are 6 types of distorted thoughts that lead to anxiety.

Personally, being aware of these types of distorted thoughts helps me to identify which of my thoughts are anxiety and which of my thoughts are valid. Being able to identify anxious thinking is the first step in dealing with it. 

1) **Probability Overestimations**- Exaggerated beliefs about the chances of a negative event or outcome happening. 

Examples: Thinking that there is a high chance of dying in a plane crash. Assuming that your best friend doesn't like you anymore because they didn't respond to your text right away. Most ""What if..."" type thoughts. 

2) **All or Nothing Type Thinking**- Black/White thought patterns, judging everything as good or bad without recognizing that life is, in fact,  mostly ""grey area"". Judging something as negative when it is actually neutral. This type of thinking plays a big part for people that struggle with perfectionism. 

Examples: Interpreting someones neutral facial expressions as negative because they aren't obviously happy- ""If it's not positive than it must be negative"". -On diet> eat cupcake> think diet in now ruined> proceed to eat entire XL pizza & wings b/c your diet is ""ruined"" anyway due to the cupcake. 

3) **Catastrophic Thinking**- Exaggerating the importance of an event or outcome. (Not to be confused with point #1: probability overestimation, although the two are intimately related.) Underestimating your ability to cope in the unlikely event that the ""worst possible case"" does come true.  

Example: ""If this first date doesn't go well I will probably die alone with 80 cats."" When in reality, if the date doesn't go well it holds no power over the rest of your life. In reality, 5 minuets after the date is over, it doesn't matter anymore.

""It will ruin my life if my new coworkers don't like me"" When in reality, even if they hate you, you can always get a new job, or even be professionally successful without having a personal relationship with your colleagues. 

4) **Personalization**- Blaming yourself and only yourself for negative situations. 

Example ""That was an awkward conversation because I am awkward"". When in reality the other person has 50% responisibilty for the conversation.

5) **Mind Reading**- Making assumption about what others think. 

Example: ""That server was a dick to me because she doesn't like me"" when in reality she was just in a bad mood because her husband cheated on her. 

6) **Selective Attention and Memory**- This is the tendency to focus on information that is consistent with your beliefs. If you believe that the world is dangerous or that people don't like you or that you are unworthy etc etc, your brain will pay attention to ""evidence"" that is consistent with your beliefs. Kind of like how you always notice cars on the road that are the same as yours. 

Example: You notice the 3 people who you perceived to look negative during your presentation and ignore the 15 that looked positive or neutral. Or worse, you perceived the neutral to be negative (see point #2).

What types of distorted thinking do you engage in the most? What are some specific examples?

Example: ""That server was a dick to me because she doesn't like me"" when in reality she was just in a bad mood because her husband cheated on her. 

6) **Selective Attention and Memory**- This is the tendency to focus on information that is consistent with your beliefs. If you believe that the world is dangerous or that people don't like you or that you are unworthy etc etc, your brain will pay attention to ""evidence"" that is consistent with your beliefs. Kind of like how you always notice cars on the road that are the same as yours. 

Example: You notice the 3 people who you perceived to look negative during your presentation and ignore the 15 that looked positive or neutral. Or worse, you perceived the neutral to be negative (see point #2).

What types of distorted thinking do you engage in the most? What are some specific examples?

Anyone else with anxiety have a crippling fear of confrontation?,664,False,"34 year old male, diagnosed with generalized and social anxiety.

I would actually say the worst symptom of anxiety for me is a fear of confrontation.  Even when I'm 100% in the right, having to call someone out on their bullshit can be enough to induce a panic attack.  

&#x200B;

Its only gotten worse with age.  When I was a little bit younger I""d push through the anxiety and make sure my voice was heard, I would say avoiding confrontation is a behavior I've learned over the years and now it's almost impossible for me to confront someone without stuttering and stammering through it, and that is if I even have the balls to confront someone in the first place.  

 

Then, I wind up even more pissed off and upset because I end up letting someone walk all over me and then my anxiety gets even worse, or I just shut down and get super depressed.

"Exercise... seriously, do it.",662,False,"I have battled anxiety for nearly ten years now. I’ve been on and off antidepressants (been off almost two years).

But after reading a ton on how it can help anxiety and depression (which I’ve known for years) I casually just said “Ok what the heck?”. Lots of people take medicine everyday for anxiety, why can’t I try this as a form of medicine?

Overcame a panic attack on my own for the first time!,661,False,"Triggers: I talk about my panic attack 

I’m so happy I could cry! So there I was, at Starbucks, I had too much caffeine (which I shouldn’t truly be consuming to begin with) and I feel a panic attack coming on and coming on strong. 

Usually I try to shove it down. It never works but I still do it until I inevitably spiral.

But there was this barista sweeping by me. He and I had spoken a few times before this visit and I recalled him saying he was taking a summer course at the nearby community college.

I had my earphones in, trying to listen to music and shakily eat a bagel to calm down. I have social anxiety and have been trying to do some things to get over that these past few weeks such as, smiling when I make eye contact with people and attempting to have casual conversations. 

But there I was, debating whether or not I should even try casually talking to this guy in the midst of forcing back a panic attack and a strong urge to cry. After about a minute (maybe a few, not sure it felt like eternity though) I just turned my head to face him and did it! I asked him how his class was going and although I was very shaky (vocally and physically), we ended up having a great conversation. 

We briefly touched on my anxiety. I even lightheartedly made a joke about choosing whether to have a bagel or panic attack and I seriously don’t know how this didn’t kill the conversation. I wish I could remember what he said afterwards or how the conversation kept flowing. Somehow we ended up talking about a bunch of things. It wasn’t until the end of the conversation that I realized, my panic attack was gone. All the symptoms of my attack were gone as well (I don’t want to list them and trigger someone).

Not saying for people to try this at all, I’m just happy I overcame a panic attack and wanted to share this excitement with somebody.

A dumb (but useful!) little anxiety trick.,647,False,"Tl;dr I have a method for remembering that I did something, so I won’t be worrying all day about whether or not I did it, and worrying about the consequences of forgetting to have done it.


Ok so sometimes before work I use my hair straightener. I’m usually in a rush and have to unplug it before I go on my way, of course. But sometimes more often than not I’d be at work freaking out that I *forgot* to unplug it, freaking out that my house was currently burnt to bits, a pile of ash and debris on my lawn.

So I end up texting my mother (who I live with) asking her to please check that I unplugged it. The thing is, more often than not, I did. In fact I almost always do, and if I don’t, *it shuts off automatically anyway*. Yet I still find myself at work stricken with anxiety, wondering if I unplugged my hair straightener.

It’s an outlandish thing to be so worried about, considering I usually unplug it and it shuts off itself anyway, but my google search is still filled with “chances of my house burning down from hair straightener” “how long do automatic shut-off hair straighteners stay on” “hair straightener fire”... it’s not good.

Then recently I decided I needed something to remind me, concretely, that I did unplug it in the mornings when I do. So this is going to sound kind of silly or stupid, but now in the mornings when I unplug it I say, out loud, “I am unplugging my hair straightener”.

I don’t know why it works. Maybe because I say it out loud and hear it back to me and that reassures me. Maybe it’s because it’s a strange action (saying what you’re doing out loud to nobody) that makes me remember that I did it. I have no idea, but once I started doing this I no longer doubt whether I unplugged my hair straightener, the memory sticks in my mind and I can relax.

So I thought I would inform the people on r/anxiety about it to see if they do anything similar, or could maybe benefit from this. Perhaps this would fall under more of an OCD thing but I’ve only ever been prescribed with anxiety so I’m not sure that would apply.

my method for sleeping with anxiety,632,False,"It's no joke. This sub lights up like a Christmas tree at night. With some forms of anxiety, trying to fall asleep is the absolute worst. I've been battling it for many years and I think I have found one way that works for me.

Staying busy (mentally) is the best way to keep anxiety at bay so when we stay busy physically, we can manage. At night, the ""busy"" goes away, so our brains start churning. These thoughts lead to physical changes in our bodies that make us feel like total shit and make it hard to sleep.  i.e. increased heart rate, tension grinding, stomach pain...etc. 

We can't control the physical stuff so we have to start with the mental stuff. You have to learn to manage your thoughts. Sounds impossible, right? It's possible with practice. Here is what I do. 

You HAVE to avoid anything personal to you. I imagine a giant house. Imagine entering this house. The first floor is a long hallway full of doors. Behind each door is all the stuff you can think about that has no personal attachment to you. Television shows you watch, movies, word games, number games (stay away from music because it tends to cause memory recall to something personal) 

The trick is to STAY ON THE FIRST FLOOR. 

The second floor is anything personal to you. Friends, family, job, school, tasks, money. All these things can trigger anxiety, regret, stress. If you catch yourself thinking about something on the second floor. Back out immediately. 

The basement is the dark place. All your worst fears. Avoid at all cost. 

As for thoughts that are not personal. You will find tricks that work for you. Some things I do...

Take my favorite movie and put myself in it. I imagine myself in all the situations with all the characters and what I would say with them. Same for favorite tv shows. What would I say to each and every character if I had the chance? 

Word games. I try to come up with every word that is two letters only. I come up with words made from another word. Stupid things like that. 

Eventually, you fall asleep. 

I understand this whole thing sounds ridiculous and crazy but the trick is to not touch on anything personal to you. To control your thoughts so you can control the physical reaction to those thoughts. Try it and let me know if it works for you.

I have some sort of mental block around so many things. I just choose... not to do them. Even if they're things I really want to do or need to do.

For example, today I woke up and needed to be at work at 7. And I just chose not to go and went back to sleep. I just don't care about the consequences of things until it's too late. I've struggled with this for years and I don't know what to do about it. And I always quit before I can get fired, so I've had like 10 jobs in the last two years. I ask people to hold me accountable, I've tried working from home, in an office, in food service, it happens with hangouts with friends and writing classes I take... I just choose not to do things.

I have a lot of goals and dreams for myself. I want a lot for myself and I love to do a lot of things. But for some reason my love of doing nothing in the moment always overshadows my dreams. I literally envy people who break bones and stuff because they get to be bedridden for a month and have an excuse for just reading and watching TV and sleeping. I love sick days. I am constantly wishing I could just do nothing even though I feel good once I actually get out and accomplish things.

Does anyone else experience this? It makes me feel like I'm the biggest failure in the world.

"American politics is REALLY fucking with me, and it's making it hard to be around my family.",606,False,"I live in North Carolina.  I went to college, initially, for political science and economics, but about 3/4 of the way through that switched to education and biology because my gut told me to GTFO.

In high school, I took AP history and AP government and politics and fell in love with America's founding principles, the political system's design (and intent), and being able to have spirited, informative debates with my peers.  I was at Barack Obama's inauguration with my AP G&P class, and it was wonderful.  One of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed.

But here's the thing...  I was ultra, ridiculously, lick-Ann-Coulter's-asshole conservative during that time.  I had grown up in a trite Republican household in the rural south with traditional right-wing values and a lot of Jesus.  My grandparents are also very conservative.  Fox News was *always* on.

Things quickly began changing when I moved to Raleigh for college.  More racial and religious diversity, time away from Fox News, I discovered Reddit...  And then some personal things happened, as well.  I started having mood swings regularly, I had my first panic attack, I developed epilepsy, I was frequently in the hospital, I had no money...  I got pregnant and had an abortion.

All of this was very eye-opening.  I learned sympathy and empathy really quickly.  It was easy to be politically conservative when I was pretty much totally ignorant to the realities that most people face every day.  But going through all of that changed my view completely.  Suddenly, I saw why people needed government assistance for food, healthcare, transportation, and housing.  I understood why a woman should be free to make a choice about having an abortion (if that pregnancy didn't kill me due to my epilepsy, the child would have had major defects due to the medications I was on at the time).

NOW, though...  Look at what is going on in the US.  Every time I think shit has hit the fan, someone reaches into the shit-bucket again.  It makes me so anxious.  My healthcare is going to be fucked with, I wouldn't be surprised if ADA got dismantled, women's rights are being stripped away...  Not to mention how racial minorities are being fucked.  I might be getting screwed for being a woman, but at least I'm white...

My parents, especially my father, love *all of this.*  I've been spending a lot of time with them following my hospitalization earlier this year from February-April.  Every time I'm there, if the TV is on, it's on Fox News.  If my dad's around, he won't shut up about how *wonderful* Trump is (without giving any real reasons), he says insanely racist things, talks about how people with disabilities are just exaggerating, etc.  It makes me pissed initially, but then I just become anxious because it's so upsetting to see and hear.  Does he think *I'm* faking it, with my multiple suicide attempts and scar-covered body???

He's even got a signed picture of Trump and Melania up on the refrigerator from during the campaign when he donated to them.  Even if I was still conservative, I would've taken that shit down early last year--and, in retrospect, things were mild at that time.

He asks for my opinions, more than likely, to try to confirm how he feels.  He'll loudly commentate on whatever story Fox has on at the time, blame a minority or liberal for something, then ask what I think.  If I didn't have the political background that I do, I would not know WHAT to say.  However, I know how to play along to shut him up sooner, and that's what I do.  It's never what I believe, though, and it's such a sad situation.  I can't even be honest with him or he might just tell me to leave.

**TL;DR:  American politics is currently fucked, and it's really freaking me out.  My Dad *loves* Trump and watches Fox News constantly, even when I'm visiting, and gets all up in my bubble with his ideology whilst not knowing that I vehemently disagree with almost everything he says.**

*EDIT:  You people who are insulting me and PMing me for expressing how I feel need to get some hobbies.  If anyone would actually like some in-depth information and a timeline regarding my anxiety, look through my post history.  I didn't suddenly get anxious about this particular topic whilst having no anxiety regarding anything else.  I'm not targeting anyone specific with my initial post, I was just trying to talk to some people that I thought would understand.*

*BUT, if you do feel upset by my post, instead of calling me names or sending me threats, maybe you should recognize the fact that you feel anxious for a similar reason despite our differing political beliefs.  Because it's the same feeling.*

It's never what I believe, though, and it's such a sad situation.  I can't even be honest with him or he might just tell me to leave.

**TL;DR:  American politics is currently fucked, and it's really freaking me out.  My Dad *loves* Trump and watches Fox News constantly, even when I'm visiting, and gets all up in my bubble with his ideology whilst not knowing that I vehemently disagree with almost everything he says.**

*EDIT:  You people who are insulting me and PMing me for expressing how I feel need to get some hobbies.  If anyone would actually like some in-depth information and a timeline regarding my anxiety, look through my post history.  I didn't suddenly get anxious about this particular topic whilst having no anxiety regarding anything else.  I'm not targeting anyone specific with my initial post, I was just trying to talk to some people that I thought would understand.*

*BUT, if you do feel upset by my post, instead of calling me names or sending me threats, maybe you should recognize the fact that you feel anxious for a similar reason despite our differing political beliefs.  Because it's the same feeling.*

**Final Edit:  Looks like the trolls have gotten off work and have nothing to do this Friday night.  Well, I do, so I'm done with this thread.  I've gotten what I needed from it.  No replies or PMs related to this thread are going to be addressed.**

Kid Cudi checks himself into rehab,602,False,"Came across news this morning that Hip Hop celebrity Kid Cudi checks himself into rehab for depression and suicidal thoughts. He wrote this letter to his fans where anxiety is mentioned.

I guess I give so much of myself to others I forgot that I need to show myself some love too. I think I never really knew how. Im scared, im sad, I feel like I let a lot of people down and again, Im sorry. Its time I fix me. Im nervous but ima get through this.

I wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at Republic and my manager Dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. The music videos, album release date etc. The album is still on the way. Promise. I wanted to square away all the business before I got here so I could focus on my recovery.

If all goes well ill be out in time for Complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs.

How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,592,False,"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much, so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources. ",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7vn317/how_i_beat_my_anxiety_disorder_and_advice_on_how/,"So if you’re reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I’ve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don’t stop, I’ve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I’ve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I’ve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I’ve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I’ve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I’ve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I’m here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I’ll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn’t really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you’re at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don’t discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you’re looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don’t feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don’t have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you’ll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you’ll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It’s going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it’ll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you’re at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can’t calm down:

At this stage, you’re either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I’ve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don’t try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you’ll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn’t working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won’t stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you’ve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you’ll find it can’t. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you’re interested, the clinical term for this is “arousal reappraisal.” It’s not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being “engaged.” This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you’re at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it’s an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can’t sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you’ll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they’re no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn’t feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you’ll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you’re in a constant state of panic, they’re a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don’t recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I’ve found it doesn’t really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you’re thinking or feeling. It’s a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don’t need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you’re getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It’s much easier to feel short of breath when you’re in a position that doesn’t let you breath easily. If you’re lying down, lay on your back. If you’re sitting, sit up straight.

Once you’ve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you’re at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you’re not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here’s what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you’re going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what’s going on in your brain and body, the better you’ll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they’ll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you’re knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who’s been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you’re at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It’s aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It’s long, so I don’t think you need to do the first part, but there’s a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren’t worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as “an incurable disease” in this book. He’s not a doctor or therapist and isn’t really knowledgeable on the subject, so I’d take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn’t to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you’ll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you’re saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn’t know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who’s right for you, but this is a person you’ll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they’ll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you’re taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you’re down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It’s said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you’re anxious, but I’d like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you’re anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don’t dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you’re not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don’t need to do sprints whenever you run, but you’ll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you’re having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it’s almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you’re just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won’t go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you’re reading this, you’ve probably read the do’s and don’ts of your diet about a hundred times, but I’ll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn’t entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I’ll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won’t bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor’s discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don’t. I didn’t feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn’t to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won’t change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn’t change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you’ve been at these things for a while, you’ll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you’re at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you’ve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn’t manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you’re able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You’ve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you’re still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here’s what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It’s easy to flounder or stop, and it’s okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don’t beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it’s part of what makes us human. And it’s okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you’ve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I’d find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren’t meant to be fun**. If you’ve got social anxiety and you’re challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it’ll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you’ll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it’ll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you’re anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of “I’ve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren’t I seeing my anxiety improve?” And the answer in this case is because this person wasn’t pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn’t expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It’s okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you’re seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you’re constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can’t find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn’t mean it’s true. 

**5.** Give it time. I’ve said it before but it’s important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren’t the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it’s also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that’s kind of vague, I’ll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you’re using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you’re someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself “that conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I’m a loser.” In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don’t know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn’t see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you’re not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you’re the one person out of the fifty who’s somehow figured out you’re losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn’t make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it’s absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you’re most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they’re both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you’ll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You’re in the home stretch. This is it. You’re likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you’ve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you’ve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I’d ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you’ve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it’s a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you’re almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you’ll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don’t last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don’t really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you’ve clearly demonstrated they work. All that’s left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you’ll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you’re still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you’ll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you’ve had anxiety and use what you’ve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you’re able to ease, the better you’ll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would’ve never been able to do.

There really isn’t much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you’ve done so far and that there’s more to come.

Then finally…

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That’s it. All the voices in your head telling you you’re not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don’t really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you’re energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you’ve never had. It’s been a few months since you’ve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you’re not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they’ll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don’t have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you’ll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it’s telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it’s telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it’s telling you you’re going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that’s not true. If it’s telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don’t. If it’s telling you you’re losing your mind, remind yourself you’re not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it’s just anxiety and can’t do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You’ve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don’t fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you’ll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you’re doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you’ve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it’ll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn’t make it true. You’ll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you’ve been dreading isn’t half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You’ll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you’re at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there’s anything you want me to expand upon. I’ll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don’t log into this account all that much, so I’m sorry if I don’t get to your comment as quickly as you’d like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

I practised being late this morning. No catastrophes resulted.,591,False,"Like a lot of people here, being late ramps my anxiety up to 11. This morning I woke up a little later than I would have wanted. I've been sick this week and my sleep has been a bit off.

I hate being late but I also hate feeling rushed, so in order to get to my 9:15 am weaving workshop, I wake up every Tuesday morning at 6:00 am. It gives me plenty of time to get up, get showered and dressed, and pack the part of my lunch that wasnt packed the night before--all at a leisurely pace.

But today I woke up at 7:00. I was faced with a choice: rush, or be late. Now, usually when I face that choice, I pick the secret third option and call in absent. But I've missed a lot of workshops lately due to things like appointments, and I knew the longer I was away, the harder it would be to come back, because my brain goblins were already saying things like ""you've missed so many sessions, they're going to kick you out of the program."" They won't but they also expect you to attend, because space in the program is limited, so my goblins have a bit of grey area to work with.

Knowing that the workshop is a safe space, and knowing that I'd get a talking to (which I've never gotten so far) before they ever dropped me from the program, I chose to instead of rush, to be late. I treated it like an experiment: Let's see if I can arrive late to the workshop without completely freaking out.

I moved steadily, but not frantically, through my morning, and I left home about 15 minutes later than I normally would have.

9 Hacks To Get A Handle On Your Anxiety Right Now,591,False,"
Anxiety Hack #1: Get up and move your body!
It’s pretty hard to give in to feelings of anxiety when you’re engaged in physical activity and those happy hormones, or endorphins, are getting released. This hack works best if you start moving as soon as you begin to experience those anxious thoughts and the adrenaline creeping in because it’ll prevent the anxiety from escalating. Choose a type of exercise you enjoy or even something childlike, such as bouncing on a trampoline or doing the “Cotton-Eyed Joe.” I dare you to try one of those and not crack a giggle. Also, if possible, take it outside for the extra benefits of sunlight, fresh air, and a dose of vitamin D. 

Anxiety Hack #2: BREATHE.
One of the most effective and simple deep breathing exercises for calming anxiety and overall relaxing is the 4-7-8 breathing technique developed by Dr. Andrew Weil (based off of pranayama yoga.) 
Here’s how you do it:
Find a quiet and comfortable place to either lie down or sit up straight with good posture.
Rest the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, right behind your front teeth.
Let your lips part and make an obnoxious whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.
Then, with your lips closed, inhale through your nose as you count to 4.
Hold that breath for 7 counts.
Exhale from your mouth for 8 counts. Don’t forget the annoying “whoooooooshhhhh!” It’s key. ;)
Do this at least four times.

Anxiety Hack #3: Repeat affirmations.
Saying affirmations out loud to yourself may seem out there, but can be extremely powerful when it comes to taming anxiety. The following affirmations have worked for me at the peak of an anxiety attack when I’ve felt crippled by that impending feeling of doom and darkness. 
“I am okay.”
“I’ve been here before. This too shall pass.”
“I am more than my anxiety.”
“I will transform my anxiety into positive, calming energy.”
“I breathe out tension and breathe in serenity.”
“I breathe out fear and breathe in love.”
“I will overcome this like I always do. I am getting stronger and stronger.”
“I am safe within myself. There is nothing to fear.”
“My body is filled with loving and calming energy.”

Anxiety Hack #4: Write it out.
Journaling, or just jotting down those thoughts that are running through your mind at the speed of light, in the moment can bring you some peace. If you don’t have a journal, use the notes section of your phone and write out whatever thoughts you have running through your mind. Whether it’s a to-do list of things you need done by the end of the week, a poem, or a bunch of swear words, writing it down (or typing it out) is a form of release. Trust me, you will feel some tension lift.

Anxiety Hack #5: Listen to feel good music.
Music has a powerful effect on your mood and energy. The key is to listen to happy, calming music, even if that’s not the type of music in your Spotify library. Choose music that reflects the way you want to feel and that will soothe your anxious mind. Personally, my go-to for happy, relaxing beats is anything by Kygo, Sam Feldt, or Bonobo.

Anxiety Hack #6: Get in touch with your spiritual side.
Connecting to a higher power is pretty much a guaranteed way of calming down feelings of anxiety. Whether you choose to pray, meditate, chant mantras, or hold crystals, doing something spiritual will help ground you and give you peace of mind. My favorite way to calm my restless mind at night is to take an epsom salt bath, turn on my latest Headspace meditation, close my eyes, and just focus on my breathing. Actually, this combines three anxiety hacks into one 10-minute activity - meditating (getting in touch with my spiritual side), deep breathing (hack #2), and self-care (hack #7). 

Anxiety Hack #7: Show yourself some tender love and self-care.
There’s nothing better than stopping an anxiety attack in its tracks by doing something pleasurable for your mind and body. When you feel those dreaded, worry-filled thoughts manifest in your body as a rapid heartbeat or sweaty palms, throw your hands up, say “that’s enough!” and go treat your poor body like royalty. Get a massage, give yourself a facial treatment, get a mani-pedi, take a bath, get your hair did, anything that you know will make you feel good, physically. Taking care of yourself and your body is therapeutic. Self-care is a form of self-love and self-love produces positive thoughts and emotions, which crowd out those negative, fearful feelings.

Anxiety Hack #8: Love your anxiety.
Yes, you read that right. One of the ways we tend to make our anxiety worse is by judging it and ourselves as something negative and horrible that needs fixing. If there’s one thing you take away from reading this article, I hope it’s this -  every belief or behavior has a positive intention, therefore any negative thoughts or destructive behaviors are not the problem. They are just the best solution you have come up with so far.
What if, instead of looking at your anxiety as something you hate and want to “fix”, you saw it as the only way your mind knows how to cope with whatever it is you are dealing with? What if you looked at your battles with anxiety as victories that make you a stronger person? What if you listened to what your anxiety is trying to tell you and focus on fixing that problem?
The thing about anxiety is, we put so much energy, time, and money into trying to heal the symptoms of anxiety when what we really need to heal is the fear or trauma that triggers this unnerving cascade in the first place. Which brings me to the last hack…

Anxiety Hack #9: Listen to and get acquainted with your body.
If you’re experiencing symptoms of anxiety and you have no clue why or where they’re coming from, it’s time to take a closer look at your lifestyle choices and health. Three of the top anxiety triggers are caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. If you’re consuming any or all of these, try eliminating them from your diet for a few weeks, preferably a full month. Then, slowly add one in at a time to see how your body responds. Chances are, you won’t go back and if you do, you’ll find a healthier and more moderate way to integrate it into your lifestyle. 
Health issues, hormonal imbalances, and food allergies can also trigger anxiety. Make sure you know what’s going on inside your body. Knowledge about your body’s natural tendencies and providing your body with nourishing, whole foods is groundbreaking when it comes to managing your anxiety. Once you’re more in touch with your body and its needs, you begin to trust your mind and body and their reactions. You’ll begin to feel energy shifts when you walk into rooms or engage with others. Your intuition becomes clearer and you’ll be able to tell the difference between “good vibes” and “bad vibes”...and act accordingly.",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/c6gtvd/9_hacks_to_get_a_handle_on_your_anxiety_right_now/,"

"Finally after 8 years of severe anxiety and daily panic attacks I have finally got to the point where I no longer take daily medication, and am basically ‘cured’.",583,False,"I (26 m) am by no means saying that I still don’t feel anxious now and then but I have definitely regained control of my life. I am now living the life that I want to live. No longer is anxiety holding me back from doing anything in life I want to.

I am going to try my best to list of a few key points that helped me get to where I am today I no for a fact that I am going to miss out a lot of information just for the fact that it has took a shit ton of little things to get me to where I am.

Taking time to heal: 1 year ago I made the hard decision to take a break from my toxic job to focus on my own health, this was a super hard decision to make but it enabled me to take the time I need to push myself out  of my comfort zone and focus on myself. 

Consistently exercising and eating better: I had no self confidence and was always exhausted so I used to eat junk food most nights just because I felt like shit and the food made me feel worse,  now I eat much cleaner, no caffeine alcohol or sugary drinks stopped smoking especially cannabis, I still treat myself of a weekend to what ever I want but for the most part I plan my meals in advance and make sure I eat them throughout the week. And the benefits of exercise are well documented but could not be underestimated.

Sleep: this was harder than you might think for me and I massively underestimated its value, I have never been a good sleeper usually getting anywhere from 2/5 hours sleep a night was not uncommon, but after a lot of self experimenting what works best for me I have finally got it under control I am now getting between 7/8 hours a night and the difference is chalk and cheese, when you wake up refreshed from a nights sleep there is no better feeling. 

Took a break from ‘Soical Media’: I deleted all social media accounts (except Reddit) and to be honest I have not got them back and I don’t think I will, people portray an image of themselves to the world that they want them to see not their real selves, and it can make you compare yourself to other people which in my opinion is not healthy, focus on yourself. 

Perseverance: not everything you try is going to succeed, over these 8 years I have tried and failed more timed than I could ever count, but I always try again the next day, small victories are the key, I would push myself every day to do something I was uncomfortable doing, some days I would fail but I would try again until I could complete what I had set out to do then more. 

Take experience and tips and tricks from people who have been there before: there is an old saying I can not remember where I heard it but it goes ‘ No man is your friend, No man is your enemy, Every man is your teacher’, and basically my interpretation of it is you can learn from any and everyone, and that is what I did I did my own research and reached out to anyone with knowledge about anxiety and panic attack’s and see what they knew about it that I didn’t.

I am not writing this to gloat I am writing this so that if even 1 person out there who thinks there is no way out or that life can never go back to ‘normal’ I am living proof that there is, better days are ahead.

I hesitated but said ""fuck it"" and did it. I did it guys. I was scared and nervous all the way home. But I DID IT. I'm proud of myself and I'm even a little excited (and scared) to do it again. 

Best luck for everyone out there.

***EDIT***

Wow! I wanted to thank you all for the amazing support I've been receiving on this post. You're all REALLY sweet to have taken the time to write replies filled with hope, joy and encouragement. If anyone is curious, I drove again today because I didn't want to take the chance of letting anxiety get the best of me again if I would've waited to go back. I was less nervous and did even more different maneuvers (not the freeway though. Not  YET). 

For the people wondering what I did do make myself drive again. I know it will sound really simple but after 5 years of putting off, I had this impulse of juste doing it. Not because I wanted it but because I was tired of not being able to go where I wanted to go or applying to jobs I wanted because I couldn't drive. I had this impulse and knew that if I let myself think to much I would have hesitated. I would have convinced myself of not going. I didn't think. I just said to my SO, OK! WE ARE GOING! Haha. He was a little confused but proud. 

To ease my anxiety, I wanted to start small with some tasks I was less anxious about (driving in a calm neighborhood). That made me feel a little less anxious and even create a positive feeling that I could associate with driving. Because I started small, I was able to perceive a little bit of competence. 

Also, I was anxious of going back driving again. But again, on an impulse that I listened, I went driving again today. A little bit like exposure therapy (as a lot of you in the comments said : practice reduce anxiety!)

"Found Elsewhere - ""How to Decode a Person With an Anxiety Disorder""",557,False,"(Their title, not mine. :P) 


things we are trying to do all the time:

* be safe

things we can’t help but do all the time:

* second-guess ourselves
* behave impulsively and reactively
* take everything personally
* worry
* have difficulty accepting compliments
* have difficulty reciprocating friendly gestures
* worry
* have difficulty finding the courage to respond
* have difficulty not being suspicious of others’ intentions
* worry
* make a huge deal out of the smallest thing
* think we're bothering you

things you should keep in mind:

* we’re scared of everything
* pretty much all of the time
* it’s an actual disorder
* it manifests as impulsive behavior
* you can’t fix us with words
* telling us “worrying is silly” won’t make us stop worrying
* it’ll only make us feel silly
* and then we’ll worry even more
* “oh god, am i worrying too much? what if they call me silly again?”
* like that
* also, we wear a lot of armor
* cold, heavy, affection-proof armor with spikes
* we constructed this armor as children
* we’re fairly certain you will never be able to pry it apart
* but there is a nice person under there, we promise

things you can do for a friend with an anxiety disorder:

* stick around
* ask them if they’re comfortable in a place or situation
* be willing to change the place or situation if not
* activities that help them take their mind off of things are good!
* talk to them even when they might not talk back
(they’re probably too afraid to say the wrong thing)
* try not to take their reactions (or lack thereof) personally
(the way they expresses themself is distorted and bent because of their constant fear)
(and they know this)
* give them time to respond to you
* they will obsess over how they are being interpreted
* they will anticipate being judged
* it took me four hours just to type this much
* even though i sound casual
* that’s because i have an anxiety disorder

things you shouldn’t do:

* tell us not to worry
* tell us we’ll be fine
* mistake praise for comfort
* ask us if we are “getting help”
* force us to be social
* force us to do things that trigger us
* “face your fears” doesn’t always work
* because—remember—scared of everything
* in fact, it would be more accurate to say we are scared of the fear itself

emergency action procedure for panic attacks:

* be calm
* be patient
* don’t be condescending
* remind us that we’re not “crazy”
* sit with us
* ask us to tighten and relax our muscles one by one
* remind us that we are breathing
* engage us in a discussion (if we can talk, then we can breathe)
* if we are having trouble breathing, try getting us to exhale slowly
* (it will be harder for us to exhale than inhale)
* (sometimes all it takes is our body to realize it can push the air back out)
* or breathe through our nose
* or have us put our hands on our stomach to feel each breath
* or have us put a hand on your chest and breath with you
* ask us what needs to change in our environment in order for us to feel safe
* help us change it
* usually, just knowing that we have someone on our side willing to fight our scary monsters with us is enough to calm us down

if you have an anxiety disorder:

* it’s okay.
* even if you worry that it’s not okay.
* it’s still okay. it’s okay to be scared. it’s okay to be scared of being scared.
* you are not crazy. you are not a freak.
* I know there’s a person under all that armor.
* and i know you feel isolated because of it.
* I won’t make you take it off.
* but know that you are not alone.

"My cat knows when I’m having a panic attack and does her best to ground me and help me calm down during, even though she’s normally not affectionate in that way.",547,False,"Honey is a fat calico cat, she’s a little over five years old and I got her from the shelter at a few weeks old (she was trying to shove her head through the door of the cage). She’s my little baby; follows me everywhere, sleeps in my room when I’m there, and finds anywhere close but too close to sit to me. She’s not a touchy kind of cat, she has her moods but most of the time she just wants to be near me and not be touched or held. Something you should know about her is that she LOVES kneading, but if you pet her while she’s doing it she’ll stop and probably move away.

I woke up in the middle of the night 
 and started having a panic attack. Almost immediately as I begin doing breathing exercises (that somehow weren’t working this time), she jumps onto the bed and sits right next to me, a few inches from touching me. She starts kneading my blanket and meowing at me, then she walks back and forth and around me, making sure she’s rubbing against me the entire time. The whole time she’s purring and occasionally meowing at me. I start petting her and talking to her, I start calming down because she’s now keeping me grounded in reality by rubbing on me like that and letting me pet her. She goes back to my side and continues to knead on my blanket while I pet her.

She doesn’t move away when I keep petting her, even though she’s kneading. She’s purring louder than I usually hear her purr, but not meowing. Until I start getting panicked again, even though I’m petting her. She meows like she’s bringing me back to reality. We do this for a while longer, then I lay back down in bed and continue doing breathing exercises, hoping to get back to sleep.

She comes up and lays right next to my pillow (not a typical spot for her as she doesn’t appreciate being brushed against even on accident if she didn’t want pet), curls up, and gets in a position to sleep there with me. I gently put my arm so it’s touching her back (she’s really soft and it’s comforting), she glances at me before putting her head back down to sleep.

It might be silly and sort of tiny, but it really amazes me how quickly she came to my rescue. Granted, she’s gotten me through several attacks and it wouldn’t be hard for her to recognize the difference. This attack was more recent, but as I laid there touching her back I just thought about how sweet it is she at least seems to know when I’m having an attack and how to handle it as best she can.

I’m so glad I have her as most of my panic attacks are in the middle of the night (1-3AM usually), so I can’t talk to people I know would help me calm down because they’re asleep. My little helper is always here for me.

I hope you all enjoyed this story, I just wanted to share how much my cat helps me calm down. :)

My therapist had me try Brainspotting on Friday. Holy shit.,550,False,"I've had anxiety ever since I can remember. The past couple years it's gotten to a point where it was getting so bad that I was developing depression, ruining relationships with friends and family, not leaving my apartment, etc. It was causing a lot of strain on my relationship as well. So after years of saying I'd go see someone.. I finally started seeing someone about a month ago.

Last week she wanted to do a Brainspotting session with me to see what kinds of mid-brain emotions and feelings we could uncover and release. And see how my anxiety manifests, and where, as we learn to identify my thoughts and find potential triggers.

It was intense. I remember when she first explained it to me, I was skeptical. I didn't understand how that could possibly do me any good or even get a reaction. But it did.

We did that for my entire session. I thought about memories I had long forgotten about. Felt my arms get painfully hot, then go numb. My temple throbbed where I get migraines. I cried - a lot. I found it hard to swallow and breathe.

And then with I'd say about 10 minutes left, I felt relief. Not just from those things, but actual mental relief. I felt it leave through my fingertips. I smiled. I still was having thoughts of these people and events, but then went from being negative and hopeless to appreciative and grateful. 

My anxiety over the weekend was basically non-existant. I actaully made an effort to see friends. I felt energy. I felt like a literal weight was lifted off of my shoulders.

I'm not sure anyone else has done this yet, or what their experience has been with it. But I'm interested to hear if you have.

In a few days my university classes are going to start again and I was unsure about a few things regarding the timetable. Anyway, the obvious solution would lie in asking people who take the same classes, right?

I had to force myself to text into a group chat with people that I'm friendly and never had a problem with. They're all nice and helpful. But since there were no classes, I didn't see them for a while.

Asked a woman out after four years...,546,False,"{final update posted at bottom of post}

Welp. 

2014 was the last time I had a date. 

I work at a very busy restaurant and usually abstain from, “Shitting where I eat.” This time was different. They hired a new hostess and I was taken aback by her beauty and grace within the first thirty seconds I saw her on her first shift. 

I, the contemplative and patient type, waited two weeks to see if she would stick around and whatnot. 

I found out that one of my favorite female coworkers is her best friend! I had an in. 

I gathered up the courage with aid from an ‘AskReddit’ post by a female I read years ago. 

ELI5: instead of asking a woman “out”... ask her to get something specific to eat with you or do something specific with you instead. I.e. - “Let me take you out to get Pho tomorrow.” > “Let’s go out on Friday night.”

I used the former example and it worked! She said yes immediately and said that I was speaking her language and that she couldn’t wait! She gave me her number shortly after. 

I’m severely out of the swing of things in terms of dating and found inspiration in this act tonight. 

I plan on taking her out tonight if she’s free. 

I really haven’t felt genuine happiness in years and wanted to vent / share with someone!  

Much like a lot of you, I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression throughout the years. So it’s nice to have a break and a light of hope shine through!


Part kismet - found out we live in the same apartment complex. Weird. 

TL;DR - 2014 was the last time I had a date. Have a new coworker who is graceful and gorgeous. I thought her out of my league. I asked her out with encouragement from a post I read on Reddit years ago. Used the advice and it worked! We have a date and I got her number. She said she can’t wait to go out. :)

UPDATE: she was working tonight. It will be a couple of days until we’re both free. Thank you all for the support! It makes me happier with my decision and strengthens my love for you guys. I will keep y’all updated!

Update p2: she and I are moving shifts around to meet up sometime this coming week. Given the holidays, it will be a little tricky to nail down an exact date. I will let y’all know! Btw I’ve been keeping it cool and not blowing her phone up or anything. We talked for about 20 minutes alone tonight just learning about each other. Stay tuned!

I’m severely out of the swing of things in terms of dating and found inspiration in this act tonight. 

I plan on taking her out tonight if she’s free. 

I really haven’t felt genuine happiness in years and wanted to vent / share with someone!  

Much like a lot of you, I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression throughout the years. So it’s nice to have a break and a light of hope shine through!


Part kismet - found out we live in the same apartment complex. Weird. 

TL;DR - 2014 was the last time I had a date. Have a new coworker who is graceful and gorgeous. I thought her out of my league. I asked her out with encouragement from a post I read on Reddit years ago. Used the advice and it worked! We have a date and I got her number. She said she can’t wait to go out. :)

——————-
UPDATE: she was working tonight. It will be a couple of days until we’re both free. Thank you all for the support! It makes me happier with my decision and strengthens my love for you guys. I will keep y’all updated!

——————-
Update p2: she and I are moving shifts around to meet up sometime this coming week. Given the holidays, it will be a little tricky to nail down an exact date. I will let y’all know! Btw I’ve been keeping it cool and not blowing her phone up or anything. We talked for about 20 minutes alone tonight just learning about each other. Stay tuned!


—————-
Update p3: it’s a date! Next Wednesday!



___________
Date night! Here we go! :)

////////////

Results! 11/10

We went on an amazing date with Pho, bowling, and craft beer. We then met up with my best friend and some of his friends for board games! We got to know each other A LOT. We have many similar interests! We talked about just honestly seeing each other and seeing if it turns into something. I was a “perfect gentlemen” and she said yes to a second date! 

Put yourself out there. The results may surprise you! 

Thank you all for the love and support. I’m happy :)",a7lr8c,Anxiety,828

The 5 by 5 rule helps me get out of my head,518,False,"I read somewhere this rule, and it might seem cliche or whatever but the more I try and remind myself, the easier it helps me cope when I can't stop worrying about that thing I did/said/should've done and can't let it go:

5 by 5: If it's not going to matter in 5 years, don't spend more than 5 minutes thinking about it.

Edit- More context: It's saying for example; I feel really anxious after my boss mentioned I did something small wrong, and even though I know it won't affect my career and my boss is friendly I'm full of anxiety that I'm an idiot.

I then think, is this tiny mistake that I made today, going to have any bearing on my life in five years time? No, so I should just stop thinking about it and move on.

Even if it doesn't take effect immediately, it's repetition of identifying your thoughts that does the trick.

I've had anxiety for over a decade now, and there are definitely situations the rule doesn't work, as plenty of people keep pointing out in the comments. I get that, and I don't think any single technique will apply to every scenario when it comes to anxiety, but you want to utilize as many techniques as possible, right?

I'm just saying, from my own experience, rationalising the actual impact (or lack of) that tiny situations I fret over will actually have in the future, works. 
Think small and start small. You might have anxious thoughts more than you realise, but you need to take note when it happens, and how big a deal the situation really is.

IF you know at the time it's no biggie, I remind myself, ""I know this won't affect me in five years. It's just a little speed bump, but it's not worth investing time and emotion in to"". I have told myself this repeatedly a few times now, and I relax pretty quickly after. It's a habit you need to form. I fully understand how people can interpret this to be like saying ""Well to tell myself to stop thinking something is like saying, just stop worrying and just be happy"". But this is something you are actually being mindful about, recognising that your thoughts come from anxiety and not necessarily a rational place, and making the conscious effort to put a stop to it. Of course it's not always going to be possible, but just keep at it and you'll find it gets easier.

2nd edit: I think most valid reason for thinking this rule is stupid, is because maybe you're thinking off applying it in situations that ARE important and anxiety inducing.

You're anxious about the fact that you have ten dollars in your bank account? Guess what? That's a very valid concern and genuine stressor for any human. This rule will not apply, and no sorry I don't have some other solution for this because a) I'm not a psychologist and b) I'm still trying to fix my own problems, I'm just here to share a rule that may or may not apply in some way in your life.

You're anxious because someone mentioned that you have a weird laugh? Then apply this rule. Sometimes I go one slightly morbid step further and think, on my deathbed, is this going to be something that I wish I had done differently?
So I'm dying, do I think, damn I wish my laugh wasn't so hideous? If I could have just changed that ONE thing, it would be my laugh?
I highly doubt it. It's all about putting things in to perspective and as my title says, getting out of my head.",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/bu83xn/the_5_by_5_rule_helps_me_get_out_of_my_head/,"I read somewhere this rule, and it might seem cliche or whatever but the more I try and remind myself, the easier it helps me cope when I can't stop worrying about that thing I did/said/should've done and can't let it go:

5 by 5: If it's not going to matter in 5 years, don't spend more than 5 minutes thinking about it.

Edit- More context: It's saying for example; I feel really anxious after my boss mentioned I did something small wrong, and even though I know it won't affect my career and my boss is friendly I'm full of anxiety that I'm an idiot.

I then think, is this tiny mistake that I made today, going to have any bearing on my life in five years time? No, so I should just stop thinking about it and move on.

TIFU by crying during a job interview,515,False,"I have been struggling to find a job for over a year. I've had a few jobs lined up, just to have them fall through right before I was finally able to get started. Needless to say, I had been stressing before this interview. 

I had been wanting to work at this place for as long as I can remember, being that I love video games and all things surrounding them as a whole. 

The man interviewing me and I were getting along great, even after he made me wait an hour for him to finish a conference call beforehand. I even helped a child pick a couple games to buy before the actual interview. (Probably should have mentioned that to him during the interview, in hindsight)

Anyway, I got flabbergasted and scatterbrained due to the fact that the man interviewing me kept asking me questions about sales and marketing. Then...I just broke down. 

My anxiety got the better of me and I told him how badly I have been trying to get a job, how close I've gotten only to have the proposed job slip through my fingers last minute.... How I'm nearing 30 and am still living with my parents, don't have a job, have crippling depression, anxiety, etc. Basically, spilled my guts to him... 
He wasn't very sympathetic but, in his defense, I was being interviewed and straight up lost my cool in the middle of it. 

Now, I'm terrified that I blew the opportunity just because my anxiety got the better of me.

TL ; DR: TIFU because my anxiety of not being able to get a job for the longest time led me to spill my guts and cry during an interview.

EDIT: Wow! I cannot thank you all enough for overwhelming support you've shown. I feel so much better than I did when I first posted this; I feel like I'm not so alone. Not so afraid. Thank you so much for your kind words and even the gold award someone gave me for being strong.

Anyway, I got flabbergasted and scatterbrained due to the fact that the man interviewing me kept asking me questions about sales and marketing. Then...I just broke down. 

My anxiety got the better of me and I told him how badly I have been trying to get a job, how close I've gotten only to have the proposed job slip through my fingers last minute.... How I'm nearing 30 and am still living with my parents, don't have a job, have crippling depression, anxiety, etc. Basically, spilled my guts to him... 
He wasn't very sympathetic but, in his defense, I was being interviewed and straight up lost my cool in the middle of it. 

Now, I'm terrified that I blew the opportunity just because my anxiety got the better of me.

TL ; DR: TIFU because my anxiety of not being able to get a job for the longest time led me to spill my guts and cry during an interview.

EDIT: Wow! I cannot thank you all enough for overwhelming support you've shown. I feel so much better than I did when I first posted this; I feel like I'm not so alone. Not so afraid. Thank you so much for your kind words and even the gold award someone gave me for being strong. I never ever have thought of myself as strong until someone mentioned it...still don't, most days, but I'm working on it. I'm keeping my fingers crossed and my head held high. (:",bwy074,Anxiety,886
"Does anyone fear picking up new hobbies, bettering yourself, etc because of a fear of judgement?",513,False,"I've felt this for a long time, and I wanted to ask if others felt this way.

The best way for me to describe it would be an example.

Let's say I want to start reading more, or start playing the guitar. I have other anxiety problems related to starting new hobbies, but one big one is that I am scared of being seen doing something different for some reason. I don't want comments to me, good or bad. I don't even want people to THINK about me doing something new or different. I'm very lucky in that my family doesn't give me bad comments, but I can't even handle GOOD comments.

Even dairy and gluten impact your gut biome which research shows is tied to your mood. Some people are less sensitive to it, but it's worth trying.

Panic Attacks = Some pathetic shit that little sissies get in a flap about when things aren't going their way.,505,False,"Growing up I'd heard occasionally about these things called ""panic attacks"" that apparently some overly-sensitive people claim to get. Seriously? An attack... of panic? What a HILARIOUS concept!

Or maybe it's like *oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I'm running late for Yoga and I can't find my car keys and the dog just threw up* - cue more effeminate limp-wristed flailing and prancing.

Some pathetic shit that little sissies get in a flap about when things aren't going their way or the food blender spills everywhere or your girlfriend sees a wasp. 


**NO.**


**NO NO NO.**


**NOT EVEN CLOSE.**


I had no idea what panic was until panic came to me a decade ago. 


Twenty-four years old of strapping athletic just-graduated pilot; cocky and overconfident to the extreme, bitch to nobody and obnoxious master of the known universe. I'm sitting in a pleasant country restaurant with my family and six friends, chowing down my rib-eye steak with a fine red wine and guffawing loudly as I regale the table with stories and bask in my own assured invincibility in the pantheon of men. 


Then a strange little sensation, imperceptible at first. 


Maybe I caught some steak in my throat? No, that's not it. Hmmm, my chest feels kinda strange like a... woah why am I so sweaty? I've stopped talking because my throat has clamped shut like a vice. The oxygen flow has turned to treacle and my throat insists its never known how to swallow. Why is everyone looking at me? Fuck this room is TINY. SO CROWDED. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong. My heart is pounding. My lungs can't function. Vision narrows and greys. The walls spin as the lump in your throat becomes a tumor that envelopes your entire existence. 


Then there is this overpowering feeling; a welling-up of all-encompassing fear. It's like an ocean surge. A rumbling from the depths of your soul that comes from the pit of your stomach at the edge of consciousness, rushing up your throat and into your brain like an unstoppable juggernaut on a collision course with your own demise. It's that crescendo of violins from the most terrifying horror movies just before the monster erupts from the dark, and it's coming for me. My whole temporal experience of the world has turned inwards and I'm pinned helpless to the moment. Inside my head a deafening megaphone overpowers every other thought - *Something dark, evil and truly awful is about to happen to you and you're powerless to stop it.*


Am I dying? Yes, that must be it. I'm dying. Fuck. I'M ACTUALLY ABOUT TO DIE. RIGHT NOW IN THIS ROOM. This is what a heart attack feels like. Your mind swims in a freezing, clammy, boiling torrent of fractured thoughts and confusing sensations as your body assumes the twitching convulsive outline of a fish caught on a hook. Vision loses focus, eyes dart in all directions. 


MY HEART! BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM it goes, with the ruthless life-extinguishing violence of a machine-gun. Nothing seems real, seconds stretch to years. Familiar things distort into terrifying non-shapes as you try to grasp on to the slush that has suddenly replaced reality. Everything is wrong. So wrong. My universe is about to collapse. The only sensation: IMPENDING DOOM. I must escape! If only I can get out of this room in the next three nanoseconds maybe I can survive. 


I stumble to something resembling an upright position and announce garbled words in incoherent gibberish to the table before racing for the door in a shambling, hyperventilating mess. I'm dying. This is it. Any moment now. Will there be pain? I'll never see my family or loved ones again. I never even got to say goodbye. This is the end. Everything lurches and races as the world implodes around you. I sit down and hyperventilate, furiously trying to catch a breath that is never satisfied, obsessively clutching the maniac pulse in my wrist. That's no good. Stand up again. Even worse. Go outside. No, I'll just die out there. Back inside to curl up in a corner. Logic has been obliterated. I am no longer rational. All that I'm aware of is the guaranteed knowledge that I am about to pass irrevocably past the line of my sudden cardiac death. Nothing exists except my crumbling body in a thick swamp of immobilising terror. 


I'm face-down on the floor in the corner of the restaurant, panting for breath, hoping that every gasp of air I can squeeze into my lungs isn't my last and that my heart won't instantly rupture and explode in agony. This lasts an eternity. What is happening to me?
 

There is noise. A commotion. People. Hands on my shoulders. ""ARE YOU OKAY?"" ""HEY, LOOK AT ME!"" Am I okay? No I'm fucking dying you fucking idiot. Do something! Help me! *HELP ME!*



Fifteen minutes of absolute raw-faced terror pass, adrenaline and fear pouring from every sweaty inch of your soaked body. The interminable minutes seem like years. 


Slowly something comes together. The floor is the floor again. It's wooden. Brown. Shiny. I can touch it. That's okay. Hold on to it. The walls are here. I'm wearing blue jeans. My parents are hunched down next to me talking soothing words. 


IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. JUST BREATHE. YOU'RE HAVING A PANIC ATTACK. DON'T WORRY. 


Like a murky runway appearing from the fog, lights of reality slowly begin to emerge. Breathing shallows. My heart starts to slow as the aura of doom subsides into a dull roar like a distant waterfall. 


Dinner is abruptly abandoned and I'm driven home slackjawed, a prisoner to my own reeling mind of neural traffic jams. What the fuck just happened to me? 


Before I know it, I'm on the couch at home with my shirt unbuttoned. An on-call doctor arrives and I try to articulate the symptoms of my almost-death. He attaches bulbous rubber suckers to my chest to perform an ECG, EEG and other tests. Everything is normal. Ask some questions, check the history. Nothing out of the ordinary, all systems nominal. 


""He'll be fine"" the doctor laughs, putting away the machines and tape prints.  ""Classic panic attack. Rest up and drink some tea.""


And that was the day I realized that anxiety and panic attacks aren't the pitiful little hand-flailing bad hair days that I'd condescendingly imagined. 



It's not the momentary nervousness of losing your phone or being late for an appointment. It's not just some trivial moment of stressful overreacting, and it certainly doesn't just happen to weak-willed schoolgirls and pussies. That's not true panic.  


True panic is the instantaneous, all-encompassing explosive jolt of terrifying **certainty** that without a doubt, **you are about to die** - right here and right now as your heart explodes - and submerge suffocatingly into a crushing blackness you never knew existed. 


Anxiety burst into my life without warning during a peaceful family dinner while I was at the prime of my life, so confident in my mastery over the world that I never imagined a crippling betrayal would come from inside my own body.  It can come to anyone at any time. 


I don't laugh about that any more. ",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/4molsy/panic_attacks_some_pathetic_shit_that_little/,"Growing up I'd heard occasionally about these things called ""panic attacks"" that apparently some overly-sensitive people claim to get. Seriously? An attack... of panic? What a HILARIOUS concept!
 

It's probably like some precious little princess in third grade losing her shit because *Johnny flicked a booger in my hair* as her arms flail around and she screams like the little whiny girl she is. Or maybe it's like *oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I'm running late for Yoga and I can't find my car keys and the dog just threw up* - cue more effeminate limp-wristed flailing and prancing. Or perhaps when you lose your phone and *oh shit I can't find it anywhere, where did I leave it? Was it stolen? Oh my god!* You know, just like... panicking. Everyone knows metaphorically what panic is. Some pathetic shit that little sissies get in a flap about when things aren't going their way or the food blender spills everywhere or your girlfriend sees a wasp. 


**NO.**


**NO NO NO.**


**NOT EVEN CLOSE.**


I had no idea what panic was until panic came to me a decade ago. 


Twenty-four years old of strapping athletic just-graduated pilot; cocky and overconfident to the extreme, bitch to nobody and obnoxious master of the known universe. I'm sitting in a pleasant country restaurant with my family and six friends, chowing down my rib-eye steak with a fine red wine and guffawing loudly as I regale the table with stories and bask in my own assured invincibility in the pantheon of men. 


Then a strange little sensation, imperceptible at first. 


Maybe I caught some steak in my throat? No, that's not it. Hmmm, my chest feels kinda strange like a... woah why am I so sweaty? I've stopped talking because my throat has clamped shut like a vice. The oxygen flow has turned to treacle and my throat insists its never known how to swallow. Why is everyone looking at me? Fuck this room is TINY. SO CROWDED. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong. My heart is pounding. My lungs can't function. Vision narrows and greys. The walls spin as the lump in your throat becomes a tumor that envelopes your entire existence. 


Then there is this overpowering feeling; a welling-up of all-encompassing fear. It's like an ocean surge. A rumbling from the depths of your soul that comes from the pit of your stomach at the edge of consciousness, rushing up your throat and into your brain like an unstoppable juggernaut on a collision course with your own demise. It's that crescendo of violins from the most terrifying horror movies just before the monster erupts from the dark, and it's coming for me. My whole temporal experience of the world has turned inwards and I'm pinned helpless to the moment. Inside my head a deafening megaphone overpowers every other thought - *Something dark, evil and truly awful is about to happen to you and you're powerless to stop it.*


Am I dying? Yes, that must be it. I'm dying. Fuck. I'M ACTUALLY ABOUT TO DIE. RIGHT NOW IN THIS ROOM. This is what a heart attack feels like. Your mind swims in a freezing, clammy, boiling torrent of fractured thoughts and confusing sensations as your body assumes the twitching convulsive outline of a fish caught on a hook. Vision loses focus, eyes dart in all directions. 


MY HEART! BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM it goes, with the ruthless life-extinguishing violence of a machine-gun. Nothing seems real, seconds stretch to years. Familiar things distort into terrifying non-shapes as you try to grasp on to the slush that has suddenly replaced reality. Everything is wrong. So wrong. My universe is about to collapse. The only sensation: IMPENDING DOOM. I must escape! If only I can get out of this room in the next three nanoseconds maybe I can survive. 


I stumble to something resembling an upright position and announce garbled words in incoherent gibberish to the table before racing for the door in a shambling, hyperventilating mess. I'm dying. This is it. Any moment now. Will there be pain? I'll never see my family or loved ones again. I never even got to say goodbye. This is the end. Everything lurches and races as the world implodes around you. I sit down and hyperventilate, furiously trying to catch a breath that is never satisfied, obsessively clutching the maniac pulse in my wrist. That's no good. Stand up again. Even worse. Go outside. No, I'll just die out there. Back inside to curl up in a corner. Logic has been obliterated. I am no longer rational. All that I'm aware of is the guaranteed knowledge that I am about to pass irrevocably past the line of my sudden cardiac death. Nothing exists except my crumbling body in a thick swamp of immobilising terror. 


I'm face-down on the floor in the corner of the restaurant, panting for breath, hoping that every gasp of air I can squeeze into my lungs isn't my last and that my heart won't instantly rupture and explode in agony. This lasts an eternity. What is happening to me?

Hello everyone! Didn't expect it would have so many upvotes and comments- thank you my fellow Redditors!

**I want to share the story and maybe point out some of the useful tips on how to handle/ help with a panic attack, things that I learned from my cognitive-behavioral therapies and meditation:**

The background of the story: My friend was having a random panic attack for no apparent reason ^(Sometimes) ^(it) ^(happens) ^(to) ^(the) ^(best) ^(of) ^(us:),) she was crying and shaking, couldn't breathe properly, while the other friend who was with her didn't know what to do at all, not to blame them though.

First, you could start by giving them a hug (^(Obviously) ^(only) ^(if) ^(you) ^(know) ^(them) ^(personally,) ^(don't) ^(want) ^(to) ^(make) ^(people) ^(feel) ^(uncomfortable),) take them to a quiet room or indoor space (^(if) ^(you) ^(are) ^(outside,) ^(noises) ^(on) ^(the) ^(street) ^(may) ^(increase) ^(anxiety) ^(level).) In my case, we were indoor already. I then told her that she was in a safe place and I wasn't leaving until she feels better. You could also ask them what is going on/ how are you feeling? She then said to me *""I can't breath""*. So I held her hands and ask her to do some breathing exercises with me. **Start by taking a nice and deep breath, breath in from your nose for 4 seconds, then hold for 1, and exhale from your mouth for 4 seconds, and repeat.** You could either breath in and out with them, or you could count the numbers for them as a guide.

You will be surprised how much this technique would help when a panic attack occurs! While she was doing the breathing exercise, I was still holding her hands and telling her *""You are in control, you are safe, we are all here with you. Panic attacks are uncomfortable, but it's not dangerous""* etc. She was much much calmer after the breathing exercise, at this point, what I did was to talk to her to create some ""distractions"" from her and her anxiety, I find this very helpful personally when I am anxious. **Basically, you are turning your attention outward, and not to focus on yourself or the inner feeling/ physical sensations.** You could ask them simple questions like *""What did you do today?"" ""Where did you go for dinner?""* or even make some jokes along the way. Some people mentioned this technique too in the comments from the last post:

&#x200B;

* u/rogertaylorkillme: ^(What helps me is to ground myself. I try to focus on my surroundings. Things I can see, touch, hear, smell. There’s a certain way people do it but generally these things can help you realize you’re okay, life is going on.)
* u/Square-cactus: ^(Yes, this! Something similar is to do the ‘5’ trick. So find 5 things you hear, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you smell, 2 things you can see and 1 thing you can taste (or some combination of this)
* u/BiniTheMighty: ^(This helps for me to. Or find 5 red things, 4 blue, 3 green, 2 yellow, 1 purple. Or counting. Can be anything, like counting squars on my cup or number of red things on a shelf, or whatever. It helps to ground, regain focus on the real world.)

&#x200B;

Lastly, I want to share a podcast called [""The Anxiety Coaches Podcast""](https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/the-anxiety-coaches-podcast/id908153168) it has helped me so much! Please check them out if you are interested in learning more about anxiety and how to make peace with it;

Also [""Anxiety Slayer™ with Shann and Anang""](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/anxiety-slayer-with-shann-and-ananga/id348096293) They have one episode called ""How to stop an anxiety attack"" is very useful too. I have this one downloaded on my Spotify, just in case anything comes up you know.

[""Meditation for Anxiety""](https://www.headspace.com/meditation/anxiety) Again, please do meditations... I know, I know, enough with meditations, but they really helped me when I was struggling to get myself out of the house!

I hope this helps.

"Get a dog, seriously.",496,False,"I’m just reaching out to hopefully help someone out there the way that I’ve managed to finally help my girlfriend. She’s been suffering from anxiety and to be honest at times it’s nearly pushed me to my breaking point. 

I tried everything, huge amounts of support, expected nothing in return and frankly it was getting unbelievably hard and exhausting. 

I decided to get a dog, I’ve always had dogs growing up, and missed having that unconditional love. She was against it, but she’s never owned one so I pretty much went behind her back knowing she just didn’t understand, so I got “Bo” my Doberman puppy and oh my goodness... 

The shift in her personality was unbelievable. Every time she’s down or feeling anxious that dog knows and will cuddle her until she’s smiling. We go on daily walks where she is just the happiest I’ve seen her in a long time. It makes me just love the dog even more and has taken so much stress off of me, and strengthened my relationship. 

To those who have anxiety, or have a SO who does. Save yourselves, and get a doggo if you can. 

*Make sure you have the financial stability, and get a dog that’s on-par with your dog experience.  It’s important to remember they are a ton of work, large puppies especially, but the distraction is part of what helps. A lot of people get large, active, intelligent dogs as puppies and don’t understand they are a full-time job. For the protection of the dogs, if you’re a first time owner don’t get one that weighs over 30lbs when mature.*

Why do I bully myself so much? Why do I not listen to my partner when they tell me I am beautiful? Or sexy? Or that my hair has never looked better?

"Constant ""running out of time"" feeling",472,False,"For the last can't-remember-how-long, maybe my whole life, I have struggled with this feeling of ""not enough time"". I am super thankful that I have to be at work very early in the mornings or I would spend all morning thinking, ""four hours till work, three hours, two, half an hour,"" . 
But on my days off, when I wake up in the morning, my mind immediately starts spinning with all the things I need to get done that day and, ""have I forgotten anything? Will I be able to get to the post office and back in time for that appointment? Should I write this down so I don't forget? But what if because I write it down, I take too much time and won't be able to go to the grocery store as well?"" 

And on top of that, there is a layer of guilt, ""Is this a good use of my time? Is this the best use of my money? Am I being productive enough? Am I doing enough for my boyfriend as well? Am I spending too much time inside? Am I exercising enough? Am I spending too much time online? Am I talking to my family enough? Do people think of me as inconsiderate?"" 

And then, of course, there's the looming feeling of, my weekend is slowly drawing to a close, the clock is ticking and in 24 hours I'll be getting up for work, twelve hours, six hours, am I going to get enough sleep, five hours, and then, the cycle starts over. I don't even dislike my job, it is very fast-paced and sometimes stressful with difficult social interactions (hotel front desk), but overall it's enjoyable. I just feel like the time that I have to myself isn't really MY time because it's consumed by all of these horrible feelings of anxiety, guilt, and self-doubt. 

I'm sure I'm not alone in this, if anyone has any tips on what I can do to ease this, it would be greatly appreciated. I enjoy yoga & sometimes meditation, and I have a feeling that they would help a lot, but lately they keep falling into the ""not a good enough use of my time"" category.

Today i helped a student having a panic attack in a way he'd never been helped before - with empathy.,473,False,"I am a High School English Teacher. I am also Bipolar, and have lived with anxiety and depression my entire life. It took me nearly 27 years of denial, bottling it in, periods of extreme highs and lows, and constant nagging anxiety before my now wife convinced me to seek medical help - I'm doing much better now thanks to finding the right therapist and psychiatrist :). But enough about me!

Today I was heading down to the copy room to print up some tests for my next class, and I saw an overweight kid (I was a chunky kid in school as well) sitting against the wall. He was shaking and crying, clearly having a panic attack. There were other teachers, and someone from security around him. My coworkers (doing what they thought was right) were asking him over and over ""What's wrong"", ""What happened?"", ""Do you need to talk to someone?"", ""Why are you stressed?"". Every time he would just repeat the same words ""I'm just stressed out"", spiraling worse and worse as he was bombarded.

I came over to check on him, and after seeing what was happening I asked if he could come to my room to decompress for a second, i was on planning after all. They agreed, and we walked over to my classroom. I told him that I have generalized anxiety disorder, and that I've done exactly what he did. Many a time I've let it all overwhelm me and I couldn't tell the people around me any one reason ""why"", when it was just a little bit of everything. I told him that he didn't need to explain, that I knew and understood, and my room was a safe space for him.

He sat there for about 20 minutes, he cried a little more. Composed himself and then told me his name was Eddie. I told Eddie that if he ever needs a safe place that I'll be there for him, and I walked him back to his class, and then ran to make copies of my test.

I hope the rest of his day goes well, and I hope that i've made a good impact on him. Even now I worry that he might be anxious still, but I have faith that he will find the way just like I did.

I hate it when people glorify anxiety,466,False,"I see these posts every week about how girls who are anxious are ""the best wives"", how some idiots claim loud and proud they are anxious and that it made then stronger, how some of my family members laugh at others' suffering by saying anxiety is merely a part of life and they eventually snapped out of it. 

I hate it.

It makes me feel like trash for struggling. Makes me feel ashamed for reaching out. Some people I told about my anxiety issues got excited saying that made me super good at organizing things and I always seemed to know where I was going because of this, but the only reason really is that I can never make a move, even a simple social outing, if I don't know who's there, where it is, when is it over, how do I get back, what will happen. I can rarely go to anything because most people don't get it, they think I'm annoying even, to be asking how things will go, saying I should relax and go with the flow. I can't do that!

I hate this glorification! Being anxious does not make me more organized, it makes me petrified! It does not help me at all! It's not ""cool"" or ""edgy"" to be anxious, it's sometimes (most times) a horrible handicap. It does not make me an eventual better wife, it just sucks in a romantic relationship, second guessing every tone change, every wording, every glance and fearing I am not enough or too much, fearing I'm pushing people away but wishing with all my being I could do that because it would mean not having to calculate when I have to call them/give a sign I'm still alive and interested in their life, because I am... but I suck at keeping touch.

Being told my anxiety is only in my head and I should snap out of it, it hurts. It hurts because it affects me physically too and it's showing, and people don't get that being unable to have energy, being unable to sleep, being unable to enjoy any physical contact are side effects of me hurting so much ""only in my head"" It hurts so much and I wish I could switch it off, forget about it! It's like people confuses stress with anxiety. And I still haven't been to a doctor because I can't even dare to step into my school's nurse office, I run away. My best friend struggles with anxiety too and how come I can motivate her to reach out and support her, but can't take my own advices?

I've tried talking to my famiy about my anxiety issues and I was told I wasn't special and it was normal at my age, that I would grow out of it. I wouldn't dare to talk about it to the family members who would understand, because I feel like such a burden to everyone.

This is late night ramblings, I've been feeling down and empty recently and so angry at everything at the same time. 

I'm sorry. It's simply annoying to have to explain every day that I am anxious and don't know why, and no I can't help biting my nails or tapping my foot, it just happens while I'm so deep into my own head that I get lost in all the things I should be thinking about but can't in fear of having a full panic attack. It's difficult to make people who don't even know what anxiety feels like understand. It's difficult to make people who think they know understand. 

Many things going on at the same time, many responsibilities, many changes, and so little focus and composure to accomplish any of it...

While people with anxiety can be the most precious and kind and loving individuals in the world, anxiety is not pretty, it's not a likeable trait one should actively seek to develop or find in a partner. Anxiety is something people accept about others. Those who seek anxiety in a partner are likely to look for someone unstable to save or destroy, or both.

Don't like me because I'm anxious, like me because even if I'm anxious, I came to see you, support you and care for you, as friends, family and loved ones should do. 

If only they would stop wearing anxiety like a fashion statement, and thus help the misunderstanding around it die!

I see so many people on this sub struggle and I just want to say that you all are so awesome and strong. My problems are not as dire as yours, I see some of you trying so hard and it inspires me, but it also makes me so angry at the people who just want to look different and edgy and make you all look like your struggles are nothing but a cheap attempt to get attention. 

I'll stop now because this is getting more and more incoherent... Again, late night ramblings.... Sorry.

It makes me feel like trash for struggling. Makes me feel ashamed for reaching out. Some people I told about my anxiety issues got excited saying that made me super good at organizing things and I always seemed to know where I was going because of this, but the only reason really is that I can never make a move, even a simple social outing, if I don't know who's there, where it is, when is it over, how do I get back, what will happen. I can rarely go to anything because most people don't get it, they think I'm annoying even, to be asking how things will go, saying I should relax and go with the flow. I can't do that!

I hate this glorification! Being anxious does not make me more organized, it makes me petrified! It does not help me at all! It's not ""cool"" or ""edgy"" to be anxious, it's sometimes (most times) a horrible handicap. It does not make me an eventual better wife, it just sucks in a romantic relationship, second guessing every tone change, every wording, every glance and fearing I am not enough or too much, fearing I'm pushing people away but wishing with all my being I could do that because it would mean not having to calculate when I have to call them/give a sign I'm still alive and interested in their life, because I am... but I suck at keeping touch.

Being told my anxiety is only in my head and I should snap out of it, it hurts. It hurts because it affects me physically too and it's showing, and people don't get that being unable to have energy, being unable to sleep, being unable to enjoy any physical contact are side effects of me hurting so much ""only in my head"" It hurts so much and I wish I could switch it off, forget about it! It's like people confuses stress with anxiety. And I still haven't been to a doctor because I can't even dare to step into my school's nurse office, I run away. My best friend struggles with anxiety too and how come I can motivate her to reach out and support her, but can't take my own advices?

I've tried talking to my famiy about my anxiety issues and I was told I wasn't special and it was normal at my age, that I would grow out of it. I wouldn't dare to talk about it to the family members who would understand, because I feel like such a burden to everyone.

This is late night ramblings, I've been feeling down and empty recently and so angry at everything at the same time. 

I'm sorry. It's simply annoying to have to explain every day that I am anxious and don't know why, and no I can't help biting my nails or tapping my foot, it just happens while I'm so deep into my own head that I get lost in all the things I should be thinking about but can't in fear of having a full panic attack. It's difficult to make people who don't even know what anxiety feels like understand. It's difficult to make people who think they know understand. 

Many things going on at the same time, many responsibilities, many changes, and so little focus and composure to accomplish any of it...

While people with anxiety can be the most precious and kind and loving individuals in the world, anxiety is not pretty, it's not a likeable trait one should actively seek to develop or find in a partner. Anxiety is something people accept about others. Those who seek anxiety in a partner are likely to look for someone unstable to save or destroy, or both.

Don't like me because I'm anxious, like me because even if I'm anxious, I came to see you, support you and care for you, as friends, family and loved ones should do. 

If only they would stop wearing anxiety like a fashion statement, and thus help the misunderstanding around it die!

I see so many people on this sub struggle and I just want to say that you all are so awesome and strong. My problems are not as dire as yours, I see some of you trying so hard and it inspires me, but it also makes me so angry at the people who just want to look different and edgy and make you all look like your struggles are nothing but a cheap attempt to get attention. 

I'll stop now because this is getting more and more incoherent... Again, late night ramblings.... Sorry.

I came out to my family as lesbian. Mom told me I should go kill myself.,3671,False,"17 F
All my life I've lived in a small little ""redneck"" town in North Carolina with conservative parents. My Dad is a pastor at our local church and both of my parents are EXTREMELY religious. They both hate gay people. I've known I was gay since I was a child but have always been scared about coming out in fear that they would reject me because they are very homophobic people. Whenever my parents see someone gay on TV they always say things like ""Look at that fucking faggot"" or ""That's disgusting"" and it just breaks my heart. I hate living with those fucking homophobes and I always take out my hatred by cutting myself. So far I've cut around 30 scars all over my thighs, butt, legs, and lower back. No one has ever seen these scars because I always wear jeans to cover them. At least not until a few days ago.

We were having a baby shower for my cousin and my mom insisted I wear a short ugly little dress that comes up to about my lower thigh. You could see every single fucking scar on my legs. I tried my best to cover the scars with my arms but when I stood up after dinner she saw them. She pointed at my legs and asked me what the hell is that so I told her everything. About how depressed I've been. About how many times I've contemplated suicide over the last few months. And about how I'm a lesbian. 

My parents flipped the fuck out.

My dad started screaming a bunch of religious shit while throwing food at me. He told me that being gay was a sin and I was going to hell for this. He told me he didn't want ""no faggot daughter"". Then he angrily stomped out the room. My mom just looked at me in disgust for a few minutes before she spoke. She said, and these are her exact words, ""Just kill yourself you gay little bitch, you're not my daughter anymore.""

That's all. She just said that and walked out.

It's been two days since that happened and now my parents refuse to talk to me. When they see me around the house they just ignore me like I'm not even there.

I feel empty all the time, yeah, I have a diagnosis, yeah, but I still manage to doubt myself anyways. It almost feels like it’s normal to feel empty. It’s strange when people tell me they can do their school work, have a job, and feel happy by second nature. It seems like feeling this way is normal, but I also feel like I’m alone in this? It’s weird. I tell myself things like, “this isn’t because of the depression, it’s because you’re worthless and incapable of doing anything.” I tell myself that this is an excuse to sit in bed and do nothing.

This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I was going to jump off a bridge and end it all. I was drunk so it made matters only worse. As I sat there and thought to myself, a voice came in my head. This voice told me how this was the wrong thing to do, that I have so much more going for me, and I can’t lose my life over some girl. 

So here I am, 3 days later. The girl and i have discussed what our relationship is going to be like. We are on a break as this is a time for me to focus and make myself happy. My happiness can’t be dependent on another person. That is unhealthy. I’ve started seeing a counselor and just doing more & staying active. I know In the end I can conquer these demons.

I would just like to say thank you to all of you who reached out to me that night.

But the instant we say we’re giving up, everyone’s like “Oh no! You have so much to live for! Think about x,y, and z! You can’t give up! Things are gonna get better!” Yeah, shove it up your ass. You’re just trying to make sure your conscience is clean when I’m dead and gone. You think you care, but you’re really just being cautious for yourself and trying to save your own soul while acting to save another. Good luck with that. I’m tired of being told to get help. With what fucking money? All just to talk to some damn superficial person who is literally being paid to be a friend to me because I’m so fucking shit at doing it without paying? What the hell is the point of trying? I’m stuck here, just like I’ll always be. Just give me the freedom to take my leave. I’ll be happy then, but I’ll be decaying in the ground by then.

Today was my 21st birthday,1771,False,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers.

I've been deeper before, but that doesn't mean my life is wonderful. It took me a few weeks to finally defeat my social anxiety and finally called the therapist. My appointment will be next friday. I'm very nervous, but relieved. I really hope things get better from now on so I can have a normal life again. :)",bu3v78,depression,150

People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.,1653,False,"UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Regular Check-In Post,1628,False,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.  

**Edit:**  I wrote this in a comment reply below but I want to highlight it here:  We enforce the rules as leniently as possible in the case of people who have come here to get support, but strictly in the case of people who are here for any other reason. We think it makes sense to ask people who are giving help to police themselves, but we try to cut people in need of help as much slack as we can without allowing discussions that take focus away from others in need of support.

",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/anh7tv/regular_checkin_post/,"Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

We try our best to keep this space as safe and supportive as possible on reddit's wide-open anonymity-friendly platform. The community rules can be found in the sidebar, or under ""Community Info"" in the official mobile apps. If you aren't sure about a rule, [please ask us](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdepression). 

*****

Sorry about letting the last post get archived.  We've been super-busy keeping up with the modqueue and that's slowing down our work on making the community rules more clear and visible and migrated to the standard reddit rules system - we *are* spending all the available time we have on that.  In the meantime, if you're on mobile, please read the info and rules which are under ""Community Info"" on the menu when you're visiting the subreddit.  

I'd like to highlight the most common violations that create extra work for us.  Please use reddit's ""report"" function when you see anything like that.  The exact reasons are less important than the existence of a report, because that puts it in our modqueue where we will look at it first chance we get.  

*  Helpers inviting private contact as a first resort.  Nobody who's both well-meaning and knowledgeable should ever do this.  Please keep your conversations out in the public threads unless/until you've established a solid rapport, and preferably let the OP decide when it's time to go private.   

* ""I'm here to help"" posts.  These are specifically against the rules.  

* Posts that aren't directly relevant to personal experience of depression, the mental illness and/or aren't requests for support.  Everything we do here is based on our core belief that talking about depression is both important and difficult, so we need to be strict about keeping on-topic.  You don't need to have a clinical diagnosis of depression to post here, but, on the other hand, being diagnosed doesn't mean it's okay for you to talk about anything.  For example, depression is *not* loneliness, it's not low self-esteem, and it's not being sad or distressed for good reasons.  Those are all important and serious issues too, and they should be discussed, but this is not the place.

I’m sorry I’m not the best mum. I’m sorry I get so distracted. I’m sorry that sometimes my head is too cloudy to give you my all. I am really trying. This isn’t anything how I pictured parenthood being. I am struggling to keep up with the image of being ok 24/7. Just know that I love you. I stay alive for you. I keep myself in my place for you. Because I’m your mama. 
Sometimes I feel like I don’t deserve you. Sometimes I feel like I’m doing the worst job. Sometimes I feel like I’ve failed you. I want to sing songs to you. I want to talk to you. I want to do all of these things that mother and sons do together. Sometimes I struggle to eat a full meal and I feel guilty that I don’t have plenty of milk to feed you properly. You cry. I feel ashamed. I feel like I’ve let you down. I wake up thinking “I don’t want to get out of bed today” but I do, just for you. Because I love you. But why do I feel so hopeless? Why does my heart ache for you every single day? My baby, this is draining my soul. The anxiety I go through just to get money for us. Sitting in the office and having a series of attacks. Mummy is tired. Mummy is drained. Mummy wants to be happy just for you. I want to be all these things for you just so you feel whole. I didn’t want this for us. You don’t deserve to be put with a mum like me. I am a terrible mother but I’m trying my best for you. Postpartum depression is evil. It’s robbing my mind and it’s hurting mummy. I turn on my phone and it’s the only thing I’m glued to. I feel like the worlds worst mum. I feel guilty that I can’t even look you in the eyes sometimes just because of how bad I feel that you’re stuck with someone like me. You deserve better. My misery makes me forget to just hold you and give you a cuddle. Not paying enough attention brings me down even more. You’re a blessing. You’re the greatest gift that I’ve ever been given and I’m guilty because I’m not doing my job properly. I feel ungrateful. I love you so much, my honey. I feel so helpless because I have no one to talk to. I get told to get over it or stop being so sad and enjoy all of these moments. But it’s harder than it seems. I didn’t ask for this. I am trying my darling. I am trying so hard for you, you will see one day. I want to get help. But I’m afraid of being turned away. Afraid of people saying that it’s all my fault or that I’m just being stupid and emotional or to stop crying because trust me, I wish I could. Time is so precious and I’m wasting it by moping around. I’m wasting all this time to watch you grow by being distracted with my own thoughts. You are growing so fast. In the blink of an eye you’ve grown from size 0000 to 00 in just under 2 months. No matter what I am your mummy. I feel defeated and drained but I will always love you. I will always nurture you. I will always care for you. I feed you. I do everything for you despite my heart ache. I do all of my duties as a mother. I am strong just for you even though I ride through all of this pain. You keep me going. This isn’t a cry for help but just a reminder that I am trying my best to be strong.

My girlfriend died,1360,False,"Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive.

I don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though.

After about two years I got myself together and attended college though. Right now in my life I’m almost about to graduate from college. Not in film/ photography, but I think she would be proud of me.

I wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that I lost someone so important. Losing her was like losing half of my being. 

Lately I’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as I graduate. I wish she was here.   
It feels good to write this though. 

For about three years I had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately I’ve felt the desire to do so. I hope someday I find someone I can love as much as I loved her.

",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/a46ol5/my_girlfriend_died/,"Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. 

That night I could not sleep at all. The next night I slept maybe a few hours. My life took a sharp turn when she died. I was so much more lively and joyful – I just became dull and lifeless. I felt lifeless as well. This is kinda random, but I never grew my hair out growing up. It was always buzzed short, but when she died I kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years.

My experience after surviving suicide..,1211,False,"My therapist suggested maybe writing things down to help process emotions, and hell if it can help anyone else..


In June 2017 i took a walk to a park that would forever change my life, I had everything planned out perfectly, i was ready.

I tied the rope around a branch and the other end around my neck, i had wrapped my hoodie around my neck underneath the rope, i didn't want to feel the rope directly on my skin and for some reason having some cotton between my skin and the rope made me feel better.

After some hesitation, i eventually let myself drop, it wasn't a big drop, my neck certainly didn't break..but i felt a large amount of pressure in my head very suddenly, it didn't take long before what felt like a huge headrush take over and i began to lose conciousness.

Then, i woke up..on the floor with a dark figure stood over me, it was a security guard...i didn't even know the park had any sort of security.

He had cut me down and was checking if i was breathing, when he realised i was alive he didn't say much. I think i had shocked him way out of his comfort zone. I refused to let him call the police but i eventually allowed him to call the hospital, i was struggling to breath. My head was all over the place.

The man had saved my life but i was so caught up in the shock and chaos i never even thought to thank him.

I was in hospital for the night, they treated the wound on my neck, the cotton hoodie i had wedged between my neck and the rope hadn't done much to protect my skin. The hospital put me in suicide watch and the next day i was with a specialist doctor discussing what had happened and getting me access to the support i needed.

The police did turn up, but they only really enquired why i had not called them, calling the police on myself was never something i had ever really considered.

After about 30 hours or so I was taken home, i wasn't allowed to be alone so my ""Emergency contact"" my Ma, had to be with me. This was probably the most difficult conversation i have ever had in my life. Witnessing the expression on my mothers face as she learns that i had hung myself isnt something i will forget anytime soon, i had destroyed her, she was trying to compose herself but she broke down.

No amount of pain i had previously been subjected to was anything compared to what i felt witnessing that.

She had questions, i answered them without feeling the need to downplay or under exaggerate how i had felt for a large portion of my life, somehow in the recent events i had found the strength to talk to my mother about things i would just suppress before. We discussed my fathers abuse throughout my childhood and teenage years, something we had never talked about and i was not the only victim, but i did recieve the worst of the violence.

My most vivid memories from my childhood are me running down the stairs and hitting my father with pillows  to try and stop him hurting my mum, as i got older that violence was pushed onto me.

I don't know how much sense this post is making, but it really was my mum who brought me back from this.


It was at that point i decided i was no longer going to live the life i had chosen to end. 

I was going to live a better life, take big risk, drop everything and persue my dreams. I cut out all the toxic people from my life at that point, i don't miss them. I ditched my depressing job, I bought a Motorbike (cliche i know)

Motorbikes are pretty damn good for mental health, just saying.

I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab.

Or seeing a building and wondering if the impact of jumping from it will be enough to kill them?
Do they just look at a tree with strong branches and think “what a nice tree that is” instead of which branch would be best to hang myself from?

How is it possible that some people just don’t want to die? Not to mention so many people who go through painful and expensive treatments just to stay alive.

I’m out,1177,False,"Hi guys,


I just wanted to let you all know I feel well enough to finally say goodbye to this sub. I have gotten a lot of support here, got some good advice and made a great friend. 

Whenever things go South again, I’ll know I have this safe space to return to.

Thank you all, and best of luck. You can do this. 

EDIT: I thought you guys might want to know what kind of things I tried and what worked. I took 3 different kinds of antidepressants, I'm now on Paroxetine and they seem to work. I've tried therapists and that's not my jam. I spent 3 days in a psych ward after my overdose and I hated it there (other patients loved it though). The thing that worked most for me was reading. I read Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. Also: the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk. And if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. And I'm here. PM me, I promise I'll reply.",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/856z53/im_out/,"Hi guys,

No friends sitting in my room being depressed and lonely about how I’m getting further and further behind in life (still do) but I’ve improved myself so much in these 3 days.

I’ve eaten out for the first time, (like at a resturant), I been going to places I didn’t thought I could find, I’ve managed to use the city’s train to travel, didn’t think I could do that. I’ve gotten thoughts to wanna take pics on the places here like the view, but I’ve gotten thoughts saying it will look dumb but I’ve done it every time anyway!

I’ve been open to meet up with ppl, but I haven’t found anyone, and I’ve been giggling the entire time being here cause it’s so pretty and I just feel so free!

I lived in my own hotel room! Like wow. To me it’s just wow. I been continually saying to myself on my room “wow, just wow. Wow!!!” And freaked out cause I can’t believe I’m just doing this without LITTLE TO ANY ANXIETY!? Like hello?!

I ordered room service to eat, even tho I had anxiety about it! Of what he would think of me cause I’m alone in my room. But after going outside for 3h i needed a “social break” to get back the energy to go out. (Self love right?)

Now I’m at my hotel room and tomorrow I just gotta eat breakfast and then I go home. (By train btw! I never traveled this far, traveled at all rather without my parents and I TRAVELED ALONE CAUSE I HAVE NO FRIENDS!)

The clock is currently 9pm, I could go out and go to a club, cause I never been to a club but that feels too intimidating for me at this time. I don’t wanna operate in the night time with not knowing the streets etc. (I’m taking care of myself)

Therapy just made me more aware of how isolated I feel because most people suck at empathy,1052,False,"I’ve been in therapy for years. In that I’ve been able to identify what has made me so depressed growing up and I try to deal with it. I spend a lot of time using coping methods and trying my best. For a depressed person I manage to excel in life.

Currently dealing with the sting of a breakup. Went on vacation to Asia and Ex broke NC before my trip to wish me well after what I gather was him finding out the grass isn’t greener.

I’m on a dream vacation with my older sister and her child while we visit her fiancé. A lot of my depression is triggered from a childhood of being parentified and also unappreciated and invalidated.

My sister spent my formative years teasing me for liking Asian culture and is now jet setting to my fantasy destination because of romantic love. Wasn’t enough that I liked something or it meant something to me for her to care or treat me right. Nope. Only a man would make her culturally open and respect me and my interests.

I was livid. I had been journaling, using positive self talk, etc but all I could think is “wow, people only care about me when I can offer them something.”

Creative services, language skill, advice, emotional support,child care...if there isn’t a task or skill I can do people rarely give a fuck about me.

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me

I didn’t want to share this, and told her I needed a moment to collect myself and she kept bothering me until I cried at a shrine. I told her why I was upset and she kept telling me to put it aside because “we’re on vacation”. I turned on my data to call my mom, she told me to pay a tour guide to take me places and hung up on me when I asked to be heard instead of throwing money at my feelings.

I literally just wanted someone to put themselves in my shoes for 2 seconds and be a broken-hearted 20 something who is the third wheel to a family and a newly wed couple, but is trying her fucking best.

I didn’t need to spend more money on experiences.
I didn’t need to pretend I wasn’t upset.

I just fucking wanted someone to walk in my very capable shoes for 30 seconds and realize the only thing I want is a little goddamn empathy.

My family rarely thanks me for things. They don’t care unless I’m in crisis or isolating. I’ve learned to ask for what I need but it doesn’t matter because unless I have extreme reactions they can’t be bothered to hear me.

I am happy for my sister. I truly am. But jfc I am planning and helping with her wedding in the midst of a serious breakup . Which she also teases me about and infantilizes my heartbreak.


Feelings don’t go away because you’re on vacation. Therapy taught me to deal with my shit, but unless I act in bad old ways my family doesn’t react.

I am more than a babysitter or a social media paparazzi. I’m part of this family too.

TL;DR depression reared it’s head on exotic vacation. Talking through issues got me yelled at...

Edit : Whoa...thanks for the gold. Didn’t really expect this but if you’re a depressed empathy like me

Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too.

I sold my guns.,1006,False,"They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

at that moment, my life lost its meaning. near the end of my junior year into senior, i stopped taking care of myself, developed insomnia (due to my obligation to try and keep up with my AP classes and my thoughts relentlessly wandering), and slept in all my classes.

You can never have an honest conversation about suicide,991,False,"When I was 18, someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note. I had planned on killing myself at the end of that week. The following events were an absolute  shit storm.

This is my plan” then I’m going to get thrown back into the Psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety”

This is how I tried to explain to my (gamer) friend how depression feels like:,987,False,"When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this. Thought I'd share it, maybe people can relate to it.

EDIT: Thank you all so much. It means a lot to me that it means a lot to you.

""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on.

And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free.

But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? 

So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. 

It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.

At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point?

You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.

By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.

When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape.""

EDIT 2: Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in.

""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing.""",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/22jqpo/this_is_how_i_tried_to_explain_to_my_gamer_friend/,"When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this.

"So I have this virus ""depression.exe"" on my computer...",985,False,"About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.

So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.

The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.

The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU.

Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.

It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model.

I don't know how it's possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel EVERYTHING. EVERY FUCKING THING. I can't breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes. So many thoughts running through my head at once. Every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things. All at once. And yet if you were to look at me, you would see the most blank, dull empty stare. I'm nothing. And yet my mind tries to be everything haha. Such a broken piece of shit. 

I think about hurting myself and dying a lot. It used to scare me. I remember the first time I genuinely thought about killing myself. It scared me. And it kinda felt good that that's how I reacted. But that was ages ago. It's so common now, it's just part of what it is to be me.


Insignificant. 



***Hey, Thank you everyone for the response. ***
When I typed this out, I didn't expect it to get noticed and I almost didn't send it again haha. I just thought 'fuck it what have I got to lose'. But I'm glad I did, I cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me. People who have commented or messaged me personally and said that I hit a personal note to them. It means a lot to me, I'm sorry if I don't get around to replying to everyone (you know how it is) but believe me that I appreciate this more than you know. 
In the future I will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send. Much love.",59449g,depression,445

What depression isn't.,970,False,"Depression isn't an emotion. Depression has no cause. Too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety.

Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.

A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope.

Currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. Luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. I wish I'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. Pills are not worth it man. Probably fucked my liver up for life. 

Oh and only one person has visited me. A friend. None of my family have so much as messaged me to see if I'm okay. I'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. How fucking dare they! I'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. I fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.

Sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.


Update:
I'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. I knew this community was amazing already but I've never made an actual post before (I'm using a alt account so when I shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) 
You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days.

Jasmine ",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6pgoal/attempted_suicide_last_night_now_im_being_guarded/,"So last night I got desperate and attempted suicide in the most stupid way. I took a bunch of pills with a lot of vodka. I would have chosen something more effective if I had thought about it more and I'm so mad at myself right now. I had the chance to die and I ruined it by saying goodbye to my friends who then proceeded to call the paramedics on me. I refused to go with them so then I got fucking detained and handcuffs. Cos the best way to deal with suicidal people is to fucking treat them like criminals 👍
Currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. Luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. I wish I'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. Pills are not worth it man. Probably fucked my liver up for life. 

Oh and only one person has visited me. A friend. None of my family have so much as messaged me to see if I'm okay. I'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. How fucking dare they! I'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. I fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.

Sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.


Update:
I'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. I knew this community was amazing already but I've never made an actual post before (I'm using a alt account so when I shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) 
You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days.

This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.  

* Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  

* Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  

* Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  

* If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  

* Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide.

My wife committed suicide yesterday,863,False,"My wife was struggling with depression for about 6 months. She attempted overdosing in December, but I found out and called an ambulance. Yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while I was out. I don't know why I'm writing this.

She operated normally as far as I could tell, but was fixated on this idea. I noticed she got worse recently but I believed it was because she was putting  pressure on herself to get back to work. I guess I was wrong.  

She thought I would be better off without her. That the pain I was going through watching her was too much for me. I truly believe that when she jumped she was partially doing it to free me. I wish I could tell her how wrong she was.

Girlfriend attempted suicide. I'm a wreck.,847,False,"I posted this on /r/suicidewatch before I realized this sub existed.

We have been dating for 7 months. I don't believe in love at first sight, but we fell in love pretty fast. We are great together. I can't imagine my life without her.

We both struggle with depression. I was suicidal a few years back, so I can understand what she is going through. I have been medicated for the past year and pretty ok; I convinced her to seek help, so she has been medicated for the past 4 months or so. Anyway....

I had just arrived at work. Only been there about 20 minutes, when I receive a phone call from her. We both hate talking on the phone, so when she calls it's usually because she can't text, so I answered and she was babbling; slurring; crying; the only thing I could understand was, ""I did it. I'm sorry.""

I bolted out of the office. She lives about 20 minutes away and by the time I got there she was in her bed laying there. I thought she was dead. I can't remember ever being that scared. I walked over to her and she was still conscious and sobbing. She had downed a bottle of wine and taken all her Klonopin.

I was able to get her dressed and take her to the hospital. She's in a mental health facility now and getting the help she needs. I'm just so afraid that when she gets out, she is going to try again and this time I'm not going to be there to save her.

I understand that it has nothing to do with me. I understand depression. I've been in a place, where no matter how much someone loves you, it's not enough. But, I can't help but beat myself up. I'm about as mushy and kind as they come. Spontaneous flowers, love poems, genuinely want to spend all my time hanging out with her, I listen and hang on her ever word, basically I know I'm a good and loving boyfriend. She kept repeating, ""I don't know why you love me so much. I'm horrible."" I tried to tell her that's not true.

Leaving her at the facility was so hard. She cried so much. She wouldn't let go of me when it was time for her to go. It's been almost a week and I miss her so much. We are never apart.

I know I'm doing everything I can. I just needed to rant and get some alternate perspectives. I went through a divorce a year ago and my circle of friends is relatively null, so I don't have a ton of people to talk to.

I'm depressed as fuck now. It's like this whole situation has made old memories and feelings come surging back. I'm not suicidal, but I sure would like to sleep for a couple of centuries. This is tough.

The Robin Williams Posts Are Triggering,837,False,"*Edit: My use of ""triggering"" in the title refers to how I felt reading articles and comments regarding Robin Williams on the night of, not the anger I felt the next day after having time to think and refresh.*

It angers me to see posts saying ""If only Robin Williams knew how many people cared/ loved him/ are sad now."" In my bouts with depression, I wouldn't have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care; or 10 page letters; or a 16-hour phone call. I'd still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think, *They don't really care. They just don't want my death on their conscience.* I'd bet money Robin Williams was the same way. Who could be more loved than a funny-man?


When someone tells me [in the context of suicide] ""I'd be sad if you died,"" I think, *Great, so I should endure my pain every day because you don't want to feel pain yourself.* I think, *How selfish.* How is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain? It's easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain. They don't feel it. They don't see it. Because if I show it, ""Hey, perk up. Be happy. Turn that frown upside down."" Depression isn't an on/ off switch.


And so I never want someone to do something they don't want to do. I can remember one time that all I wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend, but I couldn't bring myself to say that. I didn't want my friend to play just because I asked or out of some moral obligation. (And I know that if I did, at the end I'd hear ""Do you feel better?"" as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me ""less sad."") Instead I just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening, watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me.

Rick and Morty had one of the most realistic suicide attempts I've ever seen on television,827,False,"So episode 3 of the new season, at the end, Rick walks past his family, being a bit more quiet than usual, then walks downstairs and comes very close to completing suicide (he passes out at the last second.)

When I see a suicidal person on TV I feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. Maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. Now this obviously does happen, but I don't think it's the majority of attempts.

If you're standing on the edge of a building or taking any sort of steps towards suicide because you feel that's the only way you're going to get help, then you are really desperate for help.)

Anyway, for a person who has been suicidal for a long time and doesn't want anybody interfering, I feel like this  is so much closer to how it goes down. Family is home, they don't notice much different about the person, and it's completed without a lot of fanfare. You just want it done. It reminded me of Hunter S Thompson's suicide. His adult son was in the next room and thought he'd heard a book drop.

Rick is also one of the only characters I can think of that has depression and successfully hides it. He comes off as angry and mean, which is exactly what my husband has been saying about me. I'm angry all the fucking time. Because I'm in pain and I want to die, and I've used up all the fucks I had to give just getting out of bed today. I have no patience or kindness left for people annoying me or being stupid. Still, most people who know me have no idea how sick I am until I tell them.  

Rick and Morty likes to make you laugh at something, then force you to think about why you were laughing. Rick is a funny old drunk grandpa. Old people who are always taking swigs  from their flask and don't give a fuck are funny, right? Except nobody drinks like that without a reason. Healthy people do not need to be constantly drunk, the hangovers and cost to your health are enough to keep most people to some sort of reasonable level of consumption. Also, most people just don't feel the need to drink from when they wake up to when they pass out.

When I see a suicidal person on TV I feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. Maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. Now this obviously does happen, but I don't think it's the majority of attempts.

"I'm 24. My father died, my girlfriend left, my mother killed herself, and my sister was just admitted to a psych hospital. In the span of 4 months.",788,False,"I've been a subscriber to r/depression for a long time; I suffer from both depression and anxiety, and am currently taking medication that helps considerably. 

I guess I just need to get it all of my chest, and I apologize if it's a bit long. 

My parents divorced December 2012. After that, my father and I became very close, as my mother was exhibiting very selfish and irrational behavior that ended up pushing a lot of people away. My father was my mentor. He was my friend. He was a great man. 

In December of 2013, he passed away at 48. I'm 24. It was horrendous. I lost him, and was thrown into a massive storm of shit to deal with since I was the executor of his estate. 

A few weeks before his death, I began dating a girl. She was the perfect fit for me. She was smart, caring, and incredibly empathetic. When my dad passed, she began spending a lot of time at my house with me and my friends. She helped me through a lot. 

About a month and a half ago, she left. A half-cocked story about needing to find herself, and now I'm on my own, and still dealing with the aftermath of my fathers death. 

I was still not on good terms with my mom. She was not being a mother. She continued to disrespect my fathers memory, portray herself as a victim, and cut down the ones I cared about. Time and time again I gave her a chance to step up, and she failed to. 

This past week, my mother committed suicide. She wrote out her list of next of kin, took a handful of prescription strength sleep aids, and went to sleep for the last time. She decided she would rather be dead than reconcile the relationship she had with her children. 

My sister was just admitted under a 5150 as a last ditch effort for her to end her self destructive ways and get her life on track. It doesn't look promising. 

I sit here, smoking a cigarette, with my two dead parents dogs lying at my feet, and am overwhelmed by anger, loneliness, and defeat. 

I'm trying to keep myself from shutting myself away from the world and crawling back to my old hermit ways.

Being African-American and having a mental illness is literally the worst combo there is,758,False,"I just want to start off by saying that mental illness doesn't discriminate when it chooses its victims, I am just speaking from my perspective.

In no way am I saying that my mental health struggles are harder than people who comes from a different racial background, but it is difficult when you come from a community that stigmatizes and fails to recognize mental health as a REAL issue. From my personal experience and those of other black people I know, majority of us grew up being told that ""we're being ungrateful, weak, crazy or sad for no damn reason."" I am sure that other people have been told these things as well, but this is all too prevalent in the black community.

Recently, I have sought out professional help after experiencing a mental breakdown on campus. I was extremely grateful to be paired with an understanding psychologist. After the school year ended, I came back home and had told my parents of my experience with this doctor and exclaimed how much he helped hoping it would change their mind about going to a doctor, but they shot down the mere thought that anything outside of the bible could help me. The claim that ""going to doctors is what the 'world' does (they're pretty religious). All they want to do is put people on pills"". That is the furthest thing from the truth. Not once did the man I met with suggested that I be placed on any sort of medication and even if I were, I would be willing to if I needed it.

I hate that I am nothing like my family. If I believed in god, they would be more accepting of me. But I am at the point in my life where I feel that I want to believe in what feels right for me. I want to be my own person, not who anyone else wants me to be.

Was a recovering heroin addict that was on suboxone for the past 9 months and recently tapered off...  After an argument she went out and bought heroin, wrote a suicide note, and then proceeded to do it via overdose. I haven't read the note, and I'm afraid of what it's going to say. I'm so completely crushed. Every day since then I've literally cried from the moment I wake up, and throughout the day randomly until I physically can't cry anymore...  I feel like this has really messed me up in the head. I don't know what to do... Everything I do reminds me of her, and I feel extremely guilty for even feeling the slightest bit of happiness at any time. Idk if a therapist will work.... because I don't know if I want to feel happy after this...  I'm not suicidal... but I honestly don't know if I'll ever recover from this.

Edit: This has also left me financially crushed... Not going into details right now... But I'm going to have to break our apartment lease and move home with my father... might get sued for a few reasons here.... God.. help me",61k2k7,depression,650

Anyone else been depressed since childhood?,738,False,"I don't see it being discussed much. It makes me feel rather isolated. I don't think I even remember joy. I only seem to recall fear and deep sadness.

Wife is dying and I feel so lonely.,727,False,"I've suffered with depression all my life, I was raised by narcissistic parents and spent most of my life feeling alone and like I didn't fit in. My wife was the same, and when we found each other we found more than a spouse, but someone who could relate. I can't describe my love for her, we complete each other.

Around 5 years ago she was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer for the second time (at age 20) whilst she was pregnant with our daughter. We lost our daughter to stillbirth, but my wife somehow pulled through, had chemo and got an all-clear.

During this time both of our families proved themselves to be thoroughly selfish, useless and downright nasty so we both went no contact and it was the best thing we did. After four years of healing we got married and life seemed to be getting on track.

Last month I took my wife to A&E because she was passing out and having trouble getting her blood sugar under control, only for them to tell us, after a few more tests, that despite having no ovaries left the cancer had returned, somehow spread to her lung and liver and there is next to nothing they can do.

She is due to start chemo soon, and is in an awful lot of pain. She has been prescribed morphine for it, but due to that spends most of the time sleeping, while I sit here and watch over her, making sure she is ok.

The trouble is I can't talk to her about any of this, it's too painful for her to do anything but ignore at the moment but I'm devastated and alone. Besides, how I feel should be the least of her worries at the moment and I don't want to put that on her.

I feel like I'm already grieving her even though she is still here, I'm completely alone with no-one to lean on for support.

Depression is humiliating,706,False,"It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything. 

You alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. 

If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world.

A year and a half ago I was bullied at work and forced to quit. I've worked side jobs ever since and have been too afraid to apply for jobs in my field (medical assisting and gi technical specialist). I have nightmares still about my past work place. I truly am still afraid of working side by side with someone again and having them spread lies about me. 

My depression has been it's worst this year after my doctor had me lower my anti depression drug dosage because I was feeling better after a year taking my increased dosage. I soon spiraled into a mess. I financially have been struggling and that has constantly been a worry for me. Many days I stay in bed and do not shower, brush my teeth or eat. I currently cannot sleep at night without the aid of sleeping pills. I do take them now though, that's something I usually haven't done.

But a couple months ago I updated my resume, applied to jobs, went on interviews..and was hired (part time) by a local hospital with my start date being tomorrow. 

From that interview to now, yeah, I've still had a rough time. I haven't paid this month's rent and can't afford to. But I finally showered. I brushed my teeth this morning. I'll brush my teeth tomorrow morning and actually go to work. 

I'M GOING TO WORK. My new manager seems like a great person. I'm still filled with anxiety but this is an entirely new hospital system, all new (to me)people and this gets my foot in the door for a full time position when/if one opens. Plus I'll be soon helping patients again and using my seven years of experience of advanced GI procedures.

The guys looked like they were from the 80s with what they wore and their glasses and hair. I didn't participate in that conversation but I suppose I am now.

Just a few more decades and you'll die naturally :) Hang in there, every day is a living hell with no respite from the emotional numbness/pain, but do it anyway :) Depression causes you to be a worthless failure because you don't have the motivation to further your career or social life, but hang in there as a complete loser!

Then of course the natural progression beyond 'someone' is a 'therapist.' ""Talk to a therapist and get help."" Ok, let me just pull money out of my ass, and pay hundreds of dollars for someone who probably won't be able to do shit for me anyway. But that's another story...",5i74xb,depression,786

Does anyone else procrastinate to a ridiculous degree?,665,False,"So I procrastinate far *far* too much. Absolutely nothing motivates me to do work any more. Nothing at all. Back in high school I was a pretty good student. I got all my work done on time, literally never missed an assignment etc. But in college, I just can't bring myself to do anything. 

I have a huge project that needs to be completed and the idea was that we'd do a few weeks of work in class and the rest at home. Ever since the class sessions ended, I haven't even looked at it. And it was due to be finished 2 weeks ago. I open the file, look at it for a couple of minutes and then put it away. In part, it is because I find it incredibly difficult (and yes, I have asked for help but none of it made it any easier for me) but it's also because I've pretty much just fallen into a pit of inescapable procrastination. I wake up way too late, stay in bed for at least an hour after waking up, sit around playing video games, glance at my work, play more video games and then go back to bed. For god's sake, I even put off making this post for a week.

My girlfriend took her own life today. I don't know how to handle this.,660,False,"She texted me to say good bye while I was gone for a couple hours today. I was busy and didn't even see the message for 30 minutes. She was gone by the time I got back home. She had been fighting depression and I guess she lost. I called friends and family for support right after 911. They've been with me all day, but now that everyone is sleeping, I can't. The image of her hanging there will haunt me until my dying days. That was my baby, my better half. Falling asleep without her at my side just feels wrong. There's a huge hole in me and I don't know what to do or how to handle it. I just cry, I've been crying since 3pm. My face hurts, hell, my whole body hurts. To anyone that has lost their love, how did you handle it? What gave you the will to want to go another day? Or anyone that just wants to talk, keep my mind off that image. Not suicidal though, couldn't imagine putting someone through what I'm feeling.

Thanks for the kind wishes everyone. The xanax has finally kicked, in chest isnt hurting so much and I'm cross-eyed.hopefully be able to get some sleep. Can't take any more tonight.

I was able to get a few hours of sleep this morning from the xanax. Spent today with friends keeping me busy, I haven't cared about any of it. I've been out of it, just following them around, nothing matters to me anymore. I know the sun shown today, but I didnt notice it. I've caught myself pulling out in traffic without looking, not on purpose now but it has happened a couple of times. Not sure why, I guess it just doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm gonna quit driving for now. My school friend said our college has grief counseling. I will be going there in the morning. I knoweveryone is trying their best to help me, but I'm just cold. Cold and hurting and it seems to be getting worse. Tonight will be rough again. 

Everyone is sleeping again and I've taken my xanax so I apologize for spelling errors and  whatnot. Just wanted to give some back story. Beyond an abusive family she had, gang raped, losing her son 3 years ago today, losing her mother to suicide 2 years ago today. She was the most compassionate person to me. She had tried this before before we met. We didn't find, never did. Once when I did get upset with her, I caught her heating up a lighter tip and buring.her self eith. I'll finish this in the morminf

It's night time again, this is starting to feel like a journal. I want to thank everyone for their kind words and support, being able to read your encouragements and relatable stories  throughout my day has helped, more than I can express in text. Today has been one fucking hard day to put it lightly. I got some answers to my questions on why what happened did happen and that only raised more questions. I'll give an censored cliff note version to keep from airing her dirty laundry in the public, but I think its important for me to write this down. And I apologize from typing errors too, been doing this on my phone as my computer is still in the apartment. My gf wasn't from here, I never met or talked to any of her family. I didn't even know their names. She told me that there was a really bad childhood for her and that she had lost 2 children  with her husband years back. So I never asked questions, I just listened when she felt like she needed to talk about it. Eventually, she finally told me there was a younger 3rd child that was still alive with the now ex husband. She said they divorced when the children died, on Oct 15. Fast forward a year, her mother took her own life on Oct 15 for the guilt of feeling responsible. That was 2 years ago.we started dating in no November of last year. She started seeing a therapist for the past 3 months this year that was a very nice lady that she trusted. Well then her incident occurs from the guilt and grief, she blamed her self for those deaths which was completely unwarranted. The coroner had no idea of how to get in touch with family, so that's been my goal since then. I got in touch with the ex husband and an old close friend of hers from back then. I wasn't prepared for theinfo they had about her. The reason shed been crying and putting herself through hell, didn't exist. Well her mom was gone but not for what I was told. There was only two sons and they were both alive, she basically drove off one day and never came back. That was a few months before we met. She liveds those lies for the year everyone kew her here. I talked to her therapist and she was just blown away. All we can figure was that she was so much more mentally dustrurbed than any of us had any idea. Therapist figures she was delusional, maybe borderline schizo. There was really nothing we could've done to help her given the info we didn't know, it was like throwing a bucket of water on a house fire. Id here her talking to herself, but now I'm not sure that she wasn't just having conversations with someone she thought that was there. She would tell me about her conversations shed been having with her old friends that she was able to get in touch with, that really haven't heard from her in over a year. It's just so much to process. Shed actually be excited that she got to talk to them. She believed her delusion so strongly, no one had a reason to doubt it. This just makes things clearer and so much more sad.

My Wife Killed Herself Last Week.,658,False,"About a week ago my wife left the apartment, bought a gun, drove somewhere secluded, pulled over and shot herself. I have been with her since 2007 when we were still in high school. We became adults together.

I have always had mildish depression and anxiety, but she has always had major depression and suicidal ideation. It just kept getting worse and worse. She tried all sorts of medications, therapy (including DBT). She had a partial diagnosis for BPD as well.

I'm not even exactly sure why I am posting here other than to vent a bit. I see a regular therapist and have an appointment monday. I am also on an SSRI already, so I am taking the proper steps. I just am so beside myself. I always knew it would happen. She told me it would and that there was no way to change it. I lived in constant fear and anxiety that she would have a breakdown or even kill herself. I had to make so many excuses for her to my family throughout the years. I could always tell they disproved (even if only a little bit) of me putting so much effort into her. I think they better understand now.

I do not mean to be dramatic, but I feel like, even though I do not regret being with her, it has tormented me in a deep, possibility irreversible way. I know she never meant to harm me and it was the depressed train of thinking she had, but only about a week before she killed herself, I finally got her to admit what I suspected for a long time. She was distancing herself from me for 8 months in order to soften the blow of her suicide. For 8 months at least, she was purposefully distant, did not even try to console me when the situation became too hard for me. I felt so alone. I hate myself for being just a bit relieved that she is dead, because the pain of seeing her suffer was so unimaginably hard to bear.

I feel so angry at her parents, especially her mom, for always putting her down. Making her feel worthless. Her mother is the literal worst person I know. She always acted as if she supported her daughter in everything she did when out in public, but in private she shit on everything she did. My wife was literally a genius at least according to the IQ tests the doctors gave her when diagnosing her mental illnesses. She was an incredible artist who painted, drew, sewed, wood burned, and a shit ton of other things. Anything art, she could do. And her parents hated that, because she did not want to join the Navy like them or go into business. She wanted to teach and almost achieved her dreams before the depression worsened to the point that she quit school and work.

I just wish could have been different for her. All she ever wanted to do was help people and make the world better. I just want to sit on my ass and play video games. Why here and not me. I work in corrections and see a bunch of scum everyday who love the fuck out of themselves. Why not them. She never hurt a god damn soul.

Edit: A name.

Edit 2: I just want everyone to know that I was hesitant about even posting anything about my situation, but I am glad that I did because it has been very therapeutic. I only have two people in my life that really understand depression and how it affect one's thoughts, feeling and beliefs. Most of the people in my life just do not have the ability to comprehend what happened and I am both glad and deeply saddened that the people here do. So thank you everyone.

Edit 3: Thank you kind stranger for the gold. I think I know who is was, but I will just leave it at that.

"I'm almost 24, and have completely wasted the past 5-6 years of my life. I'm in such a dark place and don't know what to do.",650,False,"Hi there, I'm a 23 year old male who turns 24 in August. I have been struggling with depression for a few years now, and it's all coming to a sort of unbearable boiling point. I have completely, entirely wasted the 18-23 phase of my life, and I'm completely devastated about it.

If you'll excuse this, I'm going to allow myself to be dramatic and expressive in this post. I just need to get this out, throw it out in the world and see if anyone can help me. 

Honestly, I can say I've struggled with this all my life, but it's been more severe since 18. All I did in my younger years was play video games. I didn't learn a skill that would blossom into a career, I didn't grow into a man. I stayed a child, and I am a child now. In high school, all I did was waste my potential and genuine ability so I could play games and not have to think about responsibility. My senior year I didn't even apply for a college. I graduated and went to a community college even though I didn't know why I was there. 

From that point, all I did was aimlessly fail school for 3 years (18-21), meet a toxic girl (first love) that broke my heart after a 6 month relationship (21-almost 22), and instead of being a strong person and pushing through the heartbreak, I then let that heartbreak tumble into a toxic rut of depression that lasted for a year, where I left school and did absolutely nothing but work an unsustainable job (delivery driver with my own car that is now almost used up), lay around, and put on 50 pounds. Once that depressive period related to my ex was over, I realized with shock that I had done absolutely nothing during that time and failed an opportunity to gain inner strength. So what did I do? Did I snap out of it and start climbing upward? No. I was so horrified, and I slid into an even darker, existential depression that has lasted up to current day and is reaching a boiling point. 

The ""good"" news is that after three semesters of just laying around (not even using the time off to do something adventurous or awesome), I started back into school this spring, and though my GPA is shit from my earlier failings, I will almost surely finish with A's in both my two classes this semester. I still have no idea what I want to do long-term, but I'm ok with that. 

What I'm realizing now is sort of an exponentially increased version of what I realized after my first rut. I now realize that not only have I done nothing with my recent time, but I've done nothing during the entire 18-23 period of my life but wallow, and I will never be able to do it over. I'm almost 24, and I'm starting to feel my perception of time speed up. This is quite honestly making me panic severely. I feel like I'm going to blink and be 40, then blink again and be 70. I don't really know what to say. I feel so up against it. I could have spent the last 5 years actually finding myself, or traveling, backpacking, adventuring. At the very least I could have been responsible and had my B.S by now, and NOW I could be adventurous for a period before getting a job or going to grad school.

But now I won't finish my degree until I'm 26 or 27, and I could be 33 before I'm done if I want to pursue further education. I see people who are 18, 19, 20 and going on adventures, taking advantage of that time. People I know. And it makes me sob inside. 

I feel that there is some neoteny going on here. The thought of the magic of childhood ending has always been too much for me to think about. I feel that these years are a result of this. I was terrified to grow up. Now I'm at the age where I'm on the roller coaster of adult time with or without my permission, and I wasted those precious, fun transition years.

I wish I had done SOMETHING responsible in the past 6 years. I wish  I had worked hard, maybe learned a trade in my teens so I could have moved out, felt secure, and pursued a fulfilling career with my feet under me. I can't bear the weight of the situation I've put myself into. I can't even think about it straight enough to organize this post. The only responsible thing I've done is pay off 2k in debt last year. That's it.

My parents look at me with this look in their eyes. Like they're thinking, ""what is he doing with his life?"", that they can sense the personal Hell I've boxed myself up in. The reality of this is so damn final. 

Every time I watch a movie, I have this sort of sorrowful pang in my heart as I watch the heroism of the characters. Spiderman made me long to be 18 and start my youthful adult adventure, but do it right this time. Even about my childhood, I feel the same way. If I see a character in a movie being taught by his father to be a self-sufficient man, it makes me desperately wish I had spent my youth building skills, or learning self-sufficiency instead of gaming and ... gaming.

I just don't know what to do. My heart BEGS to have another chance, and I of course know that's an impossibility, so I feel paralyzed by finality. 

This part about my time perception speeding me up is what really  started this boiling point. I'm cracking under the weight of it. I want to grow into being a man, learn skills, become secure and self-sufficient, go on adventures, have a period of joyful expression and free adventure before I have to walk into the monotony of adulthood. But now, even if I do these things, I'll push my degree off even further, or my bank account even lower, and I'll be in my 30's before I even get to where most people are at my current age. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know what I should do. I don't even really know what I want to do. I don't want to be 24. I don't want to have this weight on me. I want to take this darkness and use it to make me stronger, wiser, more experienced, self-sufficient, mature in the truest sense of the word. I want to experience a full 50-60-70 more years, not a cheapened, sped up version that only feels 20 youthful years. I just want to conquer this, and finally experience fulfillment, adventure and joy.",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/8all7y/im_almost_24_and_have_completely_wasted_the_past/,"Hi there, I'm a 23 year old male who turns 24 in August. I have been struggling with depression for a few years now, and it's all coming to a sort of unbearable boiling point. I have completely, entirely wasted the 18-23 phase of my life, and I'm completely devastated about it.

If you'll excuse this, I'm going to allow myself to be dramatic and expressive in this post. I just need to get this out, throw it out in the world and see if anyone can help me. 

Honestly, I can say I've struggled with this all my life, but it's been more severe since 18. All I did in my younger years was play video games. I didn't learn a skill that would blossom into a career, I didn't grow into a man. I stayed a child, and I am a child now. In high school, all I did was waste my potential and genuine ability so I could play games and not have to think about responsibility. My senior year I didn't even apply for a college. I graduated and went to a community college even though I didn't know why I was there. 

From that point, all I did was aimlessly fail school for 3 years (18-21), meet a toxic girl (first love) that broke my heart after a 6 month relationship (21-almost 22), and instead of being a strong person and pushing through the heartbreak, I then let that heartbreak tumble into a toxic rut of depression that lasted for a year, where I left school and did absolutely nothing but work an unsustainable job (delivery driver with my own car that is now almost used up), lay around, and put on 50 pounds. Once that depressive period related to my ex was over, I realized with shock that I had done absolutely nothing during that time and failed an opportunity to gain inner strength. So what did I do? Did I snap out of it and start climbing upward? No. I was so horrified, and I slid into an even darker, existential depression that has lasted up to current day and is reaching a boiling point.

"I decided to ""come out of the closet"" about suicidal depression on Facebook when Robin Williams died. It went better than I thought it would. My friends were extremely supportive. This is what I posted.",652,False,"Hey, friends! Today I want to talk about suicidal depression. Every time there's a big suicide in the news, I see a lot of conversation that makes me concerned. It seems like depression is a problem that lots of people don't understand very well. I'm sorry this is so long, but it's an issue that's very close to me. 

I see people say things like ""It was the coward's way out"" or ""he threw it all away over nothing."" You should understand that depression is extremely real to people who are struggling with it. It's an illness. Your brain isn't working properly, the same way a broken limb doesn't work properly. Instead of being unable to walk, you're unable to process positive feelings. You're constantly in a state of sadness, or anger, or fear, or self-loathing. This is a lifelong condition for many people. You can develop coping strategies, but there's no real ""cure"" or universal answer. If that imagery is not helpful, it's like having goblins in your brain. It's like fighting an enemy every single day that you can't see who makes it impossible for you to be happy. It doesn't matter that you have all these nice things and people who love you, because you physically can't enjoy them or anything else. That's a really hard way to live. It hurts me when I hear people with depression described as ""weak."" They have to be strong and brave everyday, just to leave their house or have social interactions. These are people fighting a war that makes it difficult or painful to do very basic things. It is tragic when someone dies fighting that battle, but it is not shameful. 

The second thing I want to talk about is dismissive solutions. I LOVE that treatment for mental illness is becoming more socially acceptable. However, it seems like some people think the conversation ends at ""Get help."" ""If only he had gotten help!"" ""Why didn't he get help?"" ""Why didn't he dial H-E-L-P on the phone so the Helpers in the Help Van could take him to the Helpatorium?"" It is absolutely important to tell people ""get help."" It is sometimes a little patronizing when it's coming from people who don't understand how hard that is. I've seen this taken to a very nasty place, where people say things like ""it's his fault for not getting help. Why should I have sympathy?"" If you're struggling with depression, I want to stress that seeking help absolutely should be the most important thing in your life after basic survival necessities. If you've never struggled with depression, I want to stress that seeking help can be MUCH harder than you think it is. 

I have struggled with suicidal depression for most of my adult life. I called the suicide hotline back when I was delivering pizzas. It is not a magical fix-everything service. They told me their nearest facility was further away than I could afford to drive on my gas budget. I've tried talking about depression to most of my friends. I'm fortunate to have some great people in my life, but I've lost a lot of relationships because I was open about depression. There are people who don't understand, and they get angry at you when their misguided attempts to help don't work. There are people who just slowly back out of your life because talking to you makes them sad or uncomfortable. I don't blame these people. It is very difficult to deal with someone else's depression. That's nobody's fault, but it makes depression very isolating. I've tried to get professional help many times. I've had doctors who were helpful, but we couldn't afford them. I've had doctors who were unhelpful and made things worse. I've been put on medications that made me better for a little while. I've been put on medications that messed me up so badly I couldn't leave my house and had to switch high schools. This is not even getting into how hard it can be emotionally to seek treatment. You have to be able to admit your deepest problems to yourself, and talk about them articulately with total strangers. I don't know a lot of people who can do that, even without depression. It is very difficult to seek any sort of treatment at all when you honestly don't like yourself and don't believe you deserve to get better. I'm not telling this as a sob story to try and garner sympathy. I just want people to understand that everybody struggling with depression has stories like this. We almost never talk about them because we are trying to pretend to be normal.

I hate when posts like this are all criticism, so I'll try to leave with something helpful. You have so much more power than you think you do to help another person. Even when you don't feel like you're making a difference, the smallest acts of kindness can really touch people in unexpected ways. You probably don't understand depression. That is okay! We appreciate it when you are honest about not understanding. We're sick of people telling us they understand when they don't. You don't have to understand. You just have to believe us.

Dad died. No family left. Slowly drowning in bills and debt. Now I'm the sole provider for a household and I'm about to have a complete mental breakdown [29/M],642,False,"I really need some help.

Last year my Dad died from a spontaneous heart attack at the age of 66.  Zero warning.  One minute we're just talking about seeing a movie the next weekend, and the next morning the coroner woke me up pounding on the door saying he dropped dead in his truck two blocks from the house on the way to work.

Ironically, he was in great shape and we worked out every weekend.  He didn't smoke or drink and his doctor said he had the fitness of someone half his age.  He was the pinnacle of health at that age, and this happens somehow.

He was my only family and I'd been living with him for a few years after graduating college.  I'm one of those ""probably borderline autistic, zero social life"" kind of weirdos, who was in a position where his Dad told me I could just live with him, work my job, and spend free time working on my passion, which was writing soundtrack music.

In an instant my whole world - the only person who ever mattered - was ripped away from me.  The tiny life insurance dried up in a year after settling the estate and his debts and the funeral, and I'm sitting here in my office right now just about ready to scream uncontrollably.

There are so many bills, so so many bills, and my job can barely cover them.  My fiancee has been out of work for two years due to an injury and I'm supporting both of us, while trying to maintain the house, with no friends or other family to speak of, and it's a battle I'm slowly losing every day.

I don't have any time for myself any more.  I don't have time to exercise, don't have time to clean, don't have time to make music, don't have time to go back to school to get another degree that hopefully pays better than the first because I'm just at the end of my rope.

And above all else I miss my dad, every single day.

The one ""saving grace"" is that I also inherited his retirement account, which ironically he was never able to even touch.  And now I can't touch it until I'm 65 either, and I don't think I'll make it that far.  I honestly worry about being homeless, about having my whole life wasted because I'm so alone with this burden of a room filling with water and I can only take out one tiny bucket at a time.

And I feel locked within my own body and totally unable to do anything.  Some days I go to sleep and honestly hope I never wake up.

I hate this.  I hate everything.  I hate myself and this whole situation and all the people who were so mean to me my whole life, only to end up in a happy place with my Dad and then to have him taken away with no warning, no explanation, and no way to stop.

Every day of my life I want to cry, to breathe, to take a break from all this stress and sadness, and yet I have to get up and drag myself to this office because otherwise my fiancee and I will not be able to survive.

I need a break from all of this, but I can't, because my entire existence is tied to me working and trying to keep my head above water.

I don't know what to do.

My partner of 5 years dumped me. I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I lost my job. Haven't talked to anyone or been out of the house in weeks. Yesterday a good friend died from suicide. It's too much.,644,False,"A lot has happened in a very short amount of time. When shit hits it really hits hard.

After the breakup I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I'm in therapy and on meds now, which helps a bit. But it's still so bad that I had to quit my job. I just couldn't go back there. I haven't spoken to anyone, except sent a few texts, since new years. I don't go out of the house except to go to therapy. I'm too afraid. I've shut myself in and everyone else out. My friends send me texts now and then. I know they care, but I just don't have the strengt to answer them.

Yesterday I got texts telling me that a good friend, the kindest guy I ever knew, had died from suicide. I feel so guilty. How could I not have known? What is I hadn't shut him (and everyone else) out. What if I could have talked him out if it? 

With depression comes thoughts of hopelessness, despair, feelings of not being good enough, being worthless. A failure. I've felt all those things. But right now I don't just feel it. It IS me. I don't feel like a failure, I am a failure. 

There are so many 'what if's'. What if I could have saved the relationship. What if I could have saved my connection with my friends. What if I had tried harder. What if I had pushed myself and went back to work. What if I could have saved my friend.

Battling depression is a skill. Here are some tips that worked for me.,635,False,"After battling depression over the last year, I have come to discover some tips that have improved the overall quality of my life. The first, and most important discovery, was a change in the way I perceived happiness. Before my bout with depression, I assumed that happiness was my natural state of mind and that being happy is just inherent. Happiness was my baseline, I didn’t have to do anything, and I just was content. Of course, this all changed once the darkness came creeping in, and eventually my baseline emotional state was grey. Here’s what I discovered; being happy takes effort. Being happy is a skill and needs to be worked on. Thinking that you can magically become happy, or not depressed, without changing any aspect of your life is absurd. Once I got my mind around this concept, I worked on my emotional wellbeing every day. It’s a lot like weight lifting. It takes a lot of effort, it isn’t easy, and it takes a while before you see results. However, it is completely worth it in the end. 
Not everyone will derive joy from the same activities that are pleasant for me, but I will share my experience in the hopes that it helps you out. Here are the simple things I added to my life that helped lift the apathy, sadness and empty dullness I was stuck in: 

1)	**Talking about it.** I got in touch with a counselor and talked about it. We literally just sat in a room and chatted back and forth about my feelings for an hour a week. After a few weeks it really started to help. I was also fortunate to have a very loving and caring SO that put up with me while I battled through the darker times. 

2)	**Putting away the booze.** I don’t think I had a problem with booze, but it wasn’t improving the quality of my life, so I stopped drinking. Made a difference. 

3)	**Exercising. Seriously.** It might sounds cliché, but holy shit does this ever help out. Lifting weights and doing hard cardio was amazing for my mental health. While you are busting your ass in the gym or at home, you leave your problems for a brief amount of time and focus on completing tasks at hand. Lift that fucking weight 7 more times, that’s all I have to do, just lift it. The physical pain and concentration to just do simple body movements, matched the pain I was feeling inside and I was finally able to match my mind and body. Being exhausted physically felt great, and it released endorphins that gave me a much needed boost for hours after a workout. It also helped with my energy levels throughout the day, I was able to feel better and more energetic, which translated into happiness over time. Walk around the block, go for a run, do a few pushups in your room, just do it, get out of breath, push yourself for no reason, feel your body, get in the moment.

4)	**Gardening.** I never planted shit before. On a whim I bought some peat pellets, some hot pepper seeds and a few plastic containers – about a $15 investment. Best money I’ve ever spent. The process of germinating seeds, watering plants, taking care of them, and seeing weekly progress is fantastic. I read up on gardening, visited some subreddits and picked up a new hobby. I live in a tiny apartment in the middle of the city, but I have a window with sunlight and that’s all you need. Having nature around you will make you feel better, get a plant. Grow something. Take care of it, and it will take care of you. Try it out. 

5)	**Meditation.** I still suck at it, but it works. Every morning before work I take 5 minutes for myself. I just sit on the floor in my living room, look out the window and breathe. 20 deep breaths, focusing on the act of breathing. In, out, in, out. Simple. I added stretching into the mix. Stretch, breathe. 5 minutes, not a lot of time, not a lot of effort, but the mental clarity achieved is great. Stop reading this right now, take a deep breath, as deep as you can, and breathe it out. Do it again 2 more times. Try it, right now.

6)	**Vitamins and water.** Omega 3 (fish oil), Vitamin B, Multivitamin, Vitamin D. Take them. Especially the Omega 3 and Vitamin B. After only a couple days of supplementing my nutrition with extra vitamins I noticed a difference in my mood. Drink lots of water. More than you are currently drinking now. It’s not hard, go fill up a glass and drink some water. Plenty of articles out there on the link between proper nutrition levels, hydration and mental health. 

7)	**Daily log and journal.** The world isn’t out to get you, people aren’t out to get you, your problems are not impossible to deal with, but they do need to be addressed. This was hard for me to learn. Pick 1 daily goal. That’s it. What do you want to accomplish today? What completed task would take a little weight off your shoulders? Need to make a phone call? Need to pay a bill? Need to wash your sheets? Once task, one goal, per day. Write it down, that’s important. Write down your goal, and write down if you completed your goal at the end of the day. You might not reach your goal every day, but you need to try. The feeling from accomplishing tasks is great, even the small one, just recognize what needs to be done, make a goal, and try. Do it right now, open up notepad or get a pen and paper, and write down the date and what you’d like to get done today. Big or small. Just try. 

8)	**Small improvements.** Do something small that enhances your hygiene and/or appearance. Get a haircut, trim/shave, paint your nails, shower, wash your face, cut your toenails, brush your teeth, whatever. Do something easy that makes your appearance slightly better. Use some mouthwash; make your breath smell a little better. Doesn’t matter what you do, just make a tiny adjustment, a tiny improvement. Lots of tiny improvements over time make a big difference. Take care of your body, and it will influence your mental state. Look better, feel better, be better. Small, tiny incremental improvements. You will get a boost from completing the task, and overtime this adds up. 

9)	**Understand that it is a journey.** It’s hard. For you, and for me, happiness is not baseline. Our normal, everyday feelings are not happy. That’s ok. You can work towards a better life. Some of the shit that I mentioned above takes 5 minutes. The activities aren’t hard, most are enjoyable, what’s hard is bringing yourself to commit to them. Just fucking try it, please. Pick a couple and try it out. You’re taking a small step to taking back being in charge of your mental wellbeing. Yeah you didn’t choose to be depressed, I know, and probably feel like you have no control over your current state. You can help turn the tides. I went from daily suicidal thoughts, to being able to crack a smile here and there. You owe it to yourself to try. I think you can do it. You’re awesome.  

EDIT: Speaka_Engrish brought up a great point - Just to tag on to number 8, keep your room clean! Make your bed, wash the dishes, don't let little problems pile up; take care of them sooner and eventually it becomes second nature. A clean room is analogous to a clean mind.

EDIT 2: AndNowIKnowWhy made another great suggestion - Find a creative thing you like and maybe are even good at. ""Making"" something can become very meditative and self-asserting. Whether it's drawing or doing something with fabrics, wood, clay, metal, styropor, papermaché, threads or whatnot, it is an alternative form of meditation for people who are not into more common forms of it. 

Just don't do it to create something perfect, but rather to just create for the fun of it. It can be very stimulating and I like to create useful stuff for my household. Just googling the words ""easy diy"" and hit the image search will provide you with tons of ideas of which might be for you. also r/crafts, r/diy and all the other subs linked there might be an inspiration to find the right choice of material for you.

I just spent the past 15 minutes sobbing in the bathroom at work because it finally hit me that I have no friends,626,False,"It’s not their fault, it’s mine. I had tons of friends in high school, we hung out almost every day. I was always over at someone’s house, saving sleepovers, playing games. 

After high school I kept in touch with a few but you separate and move on somewhat right? Made two friends in university, I dropped out after my first semester and just started working, everyday. I was and still am too ashamed to see some people because while they’ve gone on to do good things and good schools and good jobs I’m doing nothing with my life. I’m fatter, stopped caring about my looks, boring, working a dead end job. Every-time someone asked to hangout I said I was already working. Eventually people stop messaging. Eventually people stop caring. 

I just finished up my shift and was scrolling through Instagram after getting changed. I’m alone at work and I’m just waiting for my wet mop patch to dry so I’m just standing around in the bathroom being lazy and waiting. Someone’s picture scrolls by of their birthday celebration, it’s in black and white, they’ve got big silver balloons behind them with their age, they’re dressed up, they’ve got a little tiara on their head, she looks happy and she’s tagged her friends who she’s out with. I knew her in school, not really friends and I’ve seen tons of pictures like that before loads of times, especially on Instagram.  For some reason it just struck me, being happy out with friends, someone’s taking their picture, celebrating their birthday, they’ve got a little tiara and they look like a friggan princess. My birthdays coming up and I just realized no one will ever do that for me. I haven’t been ‘out with the girls’ like that in almost 5 years. No ones going to take my picture, get me balloons, let me wear a stupid little tiara and sing me happy birthday. 

It’s so stupid, I don’t NEED those things, I feel like a spoiled child but I just feel so alone. It made me burst out crying, and I can’t stop crying even writing this because I crave friendship but I don’t even know where to look anymore. And if someone were to come along and offer me their friendship, I wouldn’t even know what to do anymore. 

I feel so stupid. I have a loving boyfriend who would do anything for me and is my best friend but we see each other every day and sometimes you just need something a little different than the same person all the time. Sometimes I feel so selfish and needy for thinking that 😖

Tonight I broke. I can't deal with loneliness anymore.,618,False,"Hi Reddit, I hope you're being okay tonight. 

I'm not. I'm gonna sound really pessimistic, I apologize for that. I'm a very positive person. I always smile, I always try to cheer up everyone. Right now I'm doing everything I advice people not to do. 

I'm going through a rough patch, but I always keep people things will get better. I usually believe so. I try and keep busy, I don't want to let depression keep me down. But tonight I broke. Tonight I can't keep going. 

I'm a 24 going on 25 Female. I'm both extroverted and introverted. I love people and taking care of them. I love making people happy. I love my family and I spoil them everytime I can. I pay most stuff for them whenever it's possible. I just like it when people are happy. My life was doing okay until recently. Everything went downhill. My boyfriend cheated on me with a girl he left me for. His friends followed him because, well, they were his friends to begin with.

A while later, while coping with it, I found out my male best friend was jealous of him and had hacked into my laptop to spy on my conversations. He'd been doing so for a while, and never bothered to tell me. 

Then an old friend of mine, male also, told me he had to stop talking to me because he had a new girlfriend that was aware that he had feelings for me and asked him to choose between me and her. 

I graduated college a while after that, celebrated alone with my family and started job hunting. I still didn't find anything. I'm not doing anything all day. I live on the money I saved. I went back to my parents' house to live with them because well... I'd broken up with my bf. 

And yet I always remained optimistic, as much as possible. I didn't want to dwell on those thoughts but loneliness was really hard to cope with. I mediated, exercised, but at the end of the day I didn't have anyone to text or to hang out with, and I'm not the best at finding ways to find new ways of meeting people. I hope finding a job will help, but I can't find anything. Yet I keep smiling, everyday. People tell me I'm brave and strong, and I want to believe them. 

But I still cry. My heart feels empty. I'd like to believe I'm better off alone and that I don't need anyone but I do. I miss my friends, I'm sick of people leaving me. I hate spending this summer all alone. I'd love to solo travel, but I can't really afford it and to be honest, I'm a bit scared. I wouldn't know where to start, and how to organize a budget. 

Guys, I don't feel depressed because I want to die. I feel depressed because I want to live so much, and I feel like I'm cursed. Everytime I made a friend in my life, I lost them, and I'm all alone. I don't talk to anyone about my little obsessions, about my favorite movies. I tried turning to my family for that. My brother and I have always been really close and I've always had his back. Last year, I paid him his dream trip. Tonight, after a week of staying on his computer with his friends, he told me he cared more about them and his girlfriend than he did me. He told me that he knew it wasn't fair, but he wouldn't change. It felt so unfair. I always helped him, I was always there for him, and hearing him willingly turning his back on me felt like too much. 

So tonight, I broke. I just burst into tears. I feel so alone, and it feels really unfair. I try to bring positivity in my life everyday, I take care of the people I love. All I expect in return is respect and a bit of support. I don't know what to do. I'm sick of being alone. I'm sick of being abandoned by everyone, I'm sick of having to pick myself up every single time to end up being hurt more. I'm not as strong and positive as people think I am. I'm simply human, and tonight I can't pick myself up anymore. I desperately need a hug, or someone, or anything. I have nobody to call, nobody to turn to, and as much as I'd like to be independent, I'm not. I've always strived to be the best of friend, and I'm sad I don't have anyone to share this with. 

I miss my old life. I feel desperate tonight. I feel broken and hopeless. I feel so lonely. 
I feel so lonely. 
I'm sorry for being overdramatic. I know it's not the end of the world. But tonight, for me, it's too much to bear. It's late, but my face is all puffy and red and I can't stop crying. 

I'm sorry for writing so much. I really needed this off my chest, even if noone ever reads it. Maybe tomorrow I'll be back to my ""normal"" self. Tonight I just needed to say that I'm not okay and that I'm desperately lonely. Friendship is one of the best things in life, and I miss it terribly. I want to have people to go on adventures with, people I laugh to the point my stomach hurts, people whose shoulder I can cry on without fearing judgement, people that'll have my back as I'll have theirs. I just don't wanna be alone anymore. I've been alone for too long already. 

Thank you again. I'm sorry, I might have killed the mood tonight. 

Edit : I genuinely didn't expect this many reactions to my post. I woke up this morning feeling like my face had been hit by a truck from all the crying and I didn't think of checking reddit because I thought it'd sunken down in oblivion already. You guys definitely restored my faith in humanity and I wish I could all take you out to get whatever it is you love eating/drinking best. (If you guys ever are in Paris...) 

I'd never written something that desperate about myself, since I thought that burying the bad emotions within would eventually make them die out. I'm not 100% okay of course, but I think I'm ready to be back on track of the positivity path and I am so happy to read that my post helped some of you. You're all welcome in my inbox anytime, for anything. I'll be happy to reply.

",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/6r10u7/tonight_i_broke_i_cant_deal_with_loneliness/,"Hi Reddit, I hope you're being okay tonight. 

I'm not. I'm gonna sound really pessimistic, I apologize for that. I'm a very positive person. I always smile, I always try to cheer up everyone. Right now I'm doing everything I advice people not to do. 

I'm going through a rough patch, but I always keep people things will get better. I usually believe so. I try and keep busy, I don't want to let depression keep me down. But tonight I broke. Tonight I can't keep going. 

I'm a 24 going on 25 Female. I'm both extroverted and introverted. I love people and taking care of them. I love making people happy. I love my family and I spoil them everytime I can. I pay most stuff for them whenever it's possible. I just like it when people are happy. My life was doing okay until recently. Everything went downhill. My boyfriend cheated on me with a girl he left me for. His friends followed him because, well, they were his friends to begin with.

A while later, while coping with it, I found out my male best friend was jealous of him and had hacked into my laptop to spy on my conversations. He'd been doing so for a while, and never bothered to tell me. 

Then an old friend of mine, male also, told me he had to stop talking to me because he had a new girlfriend that was aware that he had feelings for me and asked him to choose between me and her. 

I graduated college a while after that, celebrated alone with my family and started job hunting. I still didn't find anything. I'm not doing anything all day. I live on the money I saved. I went back to my parents' house to live with them because well... I'd broken up with my bf. 

And yet I always remained optimistic, as much as possible. I didn't want to dwell on those thoughts but loneliness was really hard to cope with. I mediated, exercised, but at the end of the day I didn't have anyone to text or to hang out with, and I'm not the best at finding ways to find new ways of meeting people. I hope finding a job will help, but I can't find anything. Yet I keep smiling, everyday. People tell me I'm brave and strong, and I want to believe them. 

But I still cry. My heart feels empty. I'd like to believe I'm better off alone and that I don't need anyone but I do. I miss my friends, I'm sick of people leaving me. I hate spending this summer all alone. I'd love to solo travel, but I can't really afford it and to be honest, I'm a bit scared. I wouldn't know where to start, and how to organize a budget. 

Guys, I don't feel depressed because I want to die. I feel depressed because I want to live so much, and I feel like I'm cursed. Everytime I made a friend in my life, I lost them, and I'm all alone. I don't talk to anyone about my little obsessions, about my favorite movies. I tried turning to my family for that. My brother and I have always been really close and I've always had his back. Last year, I paid him his dream trip. Tonight, after a week of staying on his computer with his friends, he told me he cared more about them and his girlfriend than he did me. He told me that he knew it wasn't fair, but he wouldn't change. It felt so unfair. I always helped him, I was always there for him, and hearing him willingly turning his back on me felt like too much. 

So tonight, I broke. I just burst into tears. I feel so alone, and it feels really unfair. I try to bring positivity in my life everyday, I take care of the people I love. All I expect in return is respect and a bit of support. I don't know what to do. I'm sick of being alone. I'm sick of being abandoned by everyone, I'm sick of having to pick myself up every single time to end up being hurt more. I'm not as strong and positive as people think I am. I'm simply human, and tonight I can't pick myself up anymore. I desperately need a hug, or someone, or anything. I have nobody to call, nobody to turn to, and as much as I'd like to be independent, I'm not. I've always strived to be the best of friend, and I'm sad I don't have anyone to share this with.

Edit: this might not belong here, but I'm not quite sure where to go

Edit 2: A little background of how this came about.

I was in a slump for a whole month recently, I stopped going to work, I stopped contacting my family and friends, I went in and out of hospitals for cutting myself. Since I live alone, and my nearest friend was almost an hour away, I avoided everyone in fear of burdening them to come and look for me. But few close friends still came over and helped me to get back to reality and helped me to manage myself again, and I'm slowly getting better now. During my slump a lot of my casual normal friends were asking and somehow accusing me of making excuses to just run away and avoid my responsibilities. So I came forward, texted the group chat and explain about whatever happened to me and what I felt. I mentioned that I wasn't expecting anyone to understand, I just wanted to explain myself so they would stop making accusations. Then a friend texted that to the group chat, and since last night the whole text was left at that. I didn't know what to respond, so I just went to sleep feeling blank and a bit lost. My close friends told me to just ignore because if the person don't want to be around, there are others who would be glad to help me as much as I need.

Somehow I'm kinda okay with it now, after reading all your comments. But I still wonder:

I think I'm reaching my breaking point.

About half a year ago I was doing okay. I lost so much in just three months I'm still stunned about it. First I got out of job, I will spare you the details. I thought I'd be okay, because I thought I could find something else soon enough. But then my dog got very ill. I stayed home to take care of him, but he died a few weeks later. I was completely heartbroken. He was my childhood dog, the one I grew up with, and since I had already lost another dog two years ago I was clinging onto him.

I miss him so much, but it didn't end here. Barely a week later, I'm having this huge fight with my male best friend (I'm a woman) because I found out he's been hacking into my computer and had access to all my personal info and more importantly my conversations. He confessed on spying on my conversations with my boyfriend and that he'd been doing so for six months because he was jealous of our relationship. I was heartbroken again because this guy had been my best friend for so long and I would have trusted him with my life so this definitely felt like betrayal. I decided not to talk to him anymore.

But as if it weren't enough yet, no later than a few weeks later, my boyfriend asks me if I would like ""opening our relationship"" cause you know, there's this girl that's really hot and funny and he'd love to bang her too. When I told him that it made me uncomfortable and that I thought polyamory wasn't my thing, he left me and now he's in a relationship with her. Since I was the one that joined his group of friends, obviously they kept hanging out with him.

I'm heartbroken. I'm lonely. I'm spending summer home cause well, the trip we wanted to make together was cancelled. I'm out of job, my best friend is dead, my other best friend is creepy and my previous boyfriend is a jerk. Obviously, I'm probably better off without people like that in my life, but loneliness is killing me. I never was the best at making new friends even though I love people and finally having some stability in my relationships was really refreshing for a chance.

But you have to get the materials, you have to make a plan. Even more difficult, you actually have to *do* it. And of course, you don't want to fuck it up, because things get even worse if you do.

"""Don't fool me. You don't have depression""",613,False,"This... thing...

A couple of hours ago i confided to my mom about my condition. Linking it to my tendency to hide details and lie to her and p much everyone else i deem mentally dangerous. What happened chilled me so hard, enough to have my tears stop from falling

It was a mild noon. I was cooped up with her in our bedroom (a family bedroom shared by everyone. It's a third world thing) and was on the verge of breaking apart. She had just learned of the debts I was trying to pay in secret without the knowledge of her or anyone within the household. I was trying to explain things but she wouldn't budge, uttering words like ""im disappointed in you"" again and again and again like a broken god damn record.

I had my last card. Tell her the truth, of what's going on. I gathered the courage to get up and tell her everything. ""Mom. I think i need professional help"". My voice quivered, tears started welling up. I knew i had to tell this sooner or later or it'll eat away at me like acid. ""Mom. please. I need help"" as i burst into tears. Imagine that... a 19 year old f***ing boy crying in front of his mother. Pathetic right?

That's exactly what she thought. She immediately told me to stop crying as she finds it p distasteful. I tried stopping the tears but to no avail. I told her everything. When it got to my suicide confession, what she said next just stopped me in my tracks.

""And?""

That's all she had said. She even refused to go near me during the whole ordeal, with an obvious look of disbelief, curiosity and mocking on her face. I continued to plea for help. Amusement replaced curiosity and soon enough she spoke the following words:

""You don't fool me. You don't have depression""

I stopped. I was horrified, disgusted, angry, and helpless. I thought she would understand what's what. Instead...

She blamed ME for being depressed. She told me i wasn't taking care of myself well enough and that I wasn't paying any shred of attention to whatever she says. I have, for the love of god, taken care of myself well enough to not have any minor AND major health problems. She refused to acknowledge that I have done everything by the god damn book, i am physically well, and its my mind that's breaking apart.

She then proceeded to tell me her story of how things werent all sunshines and rainbows back in her college days. Where she had no friends when she started and all that bullcrap. At the end of the day, I AM in the wrong.

Academics have played a huge part in my downward spiral. The pressure to graduate on time despite the subjects looking grimmer than ever has punched my soul hard to a pulp. I have yet to propose mom for a different approach to this spartan practice but i doubt it'll do anything significant, if it does anything at all...

I don't... know what to do. I don't want to bother my best friend with this no longer as she has a life to live, and her own problems to deal with. I don't want to burden anyone anymore. 

Help.... i'm seriously looking at the void as a better alternative than living through this hell for the next few years or so

I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding.,596,False,"Hi. 

I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down.

These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. 

The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help.

What I'm asking:

As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help.

They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year.

Thanks.

Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses.

I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction.

One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal.  Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. 

This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. 

I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch.

Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies.

It's been about three years since me and my ex fiancee broke up. I still think of her and her kids all the time. I found out yesterday that she died.,590,False,"I don't even know why I'm coming here and posting this.

Ever since the seventh grade, she was my only love. Even after we broke up, I only had one girlfriend and that didn't last too long. I could never get over her. When we broke up we didn't even talk hardly ever after a few months. 

I know that this story is all jumbled, and it will be. I don't think I could make any kind of comprehensible story right now.

God I remember everything. Every damn thing about her and that we ever did, over the past 8 years. Every. Single. Thing. 

From when I first laid eyes on her when she was my best friend's girlfriend, to the first time I went over to her house, to when she gave me my first kiss, when she moved away, when I was her support system, we were each other's only friends, when I'd stay up 8 hours a night to talk to her to keep her from committing suicide, when I found out she was pregnant with another man's child, when she was abandoned by her fiancee, when I told her I still loved her...

She was my first and only everything, and I treated her like my god. First kiss, girlfriend, first in bed, first time I felt loved, first time I could talk about my true feelings...my first time being a dad...

I remember talking to her mom and dad about marrying her. They told me they were so happy that I asked, that they always hoped for a man like me to come along. 

Her and I talked about how we wanted to get married all the time. It was going to be so perfect.

Until it wasn't. Life got in the way. We had both grown up so lonely, so abused, so broken. We didn't know how to love, how to act with those we were close to, because we were never close to anyone. 

She had postpartum. I was on some fucked up meds from destroying my back in an accident. We were both in school. We were kids, parents, students, lovers, and crazy in love. But when you have so many things pulling you apart, a slight tug is all it takes. Neither of us knew how to deal with emotions. I'd say it was like a fairy tail and things are all right, but after all those things, we ended up separating. We figured it would be best for the time. We told each other we were just going to finish school, and get steady jobs. We'd get back together, and would be a happy family once more.

Again, life isn't a fairytale. It didn't happen like that. It became a love-hate relationship. We got jealous and envious of each other, it drove us apart, and only made our love-hate relationship become more hate than love.

I feel like she hated me, and I ended up loving her. She ended up in another relationship, she got pregnant yet again, which truly ended things between us.

But I still loved her. I knew that the girl I once loved was no longer mine, and wouldn't be. It was too late. It was so hard to accept another man's child into my life, but he was without a dad and it reminded me of myself. After only a month or so, that kid meant more to me than anything in life.

I hadn't heard from her in a while. Probably a year, maybe even a little more. Yesterday, April 22nd 2019, I found out that she had died April 20th 2019. I found out today, April 23rd 2019, she was killed in a hit-and-run. I never get to tell her how much I loved her and that I was sorry for how things went. She'll never tell her kids how much she loved them. I'll never see any of them again. I knew things were over but it feels like I've lost them all over again. Her children are now orphans, and if I could I would absolutely adopt them both. I would have the kid I was there for the birth of, and raised as my own for years. And I would have I Second Son. I knew I couldn't though. Can't.

God I wish I could. I blame myself. I know people will say that I can blame if ands or buts all day, however I know for certain that she would still be alive and two beautiful children wouldn't be orphans right now if I had just done things differently. I'll never stop blaming myself. I never did stop blaming myself and I sure as hell won't now. I should have been the one to die out of both of us. I have nothing to live for. I work a shit job that is of no importance, I've been having trouble getting into school, I have no motivation, I've had one girlfriend besides her, I have two friends, one I don't even know in real life, the other I rarely see, and I don't have children.

I don't know how I'm supposed to live with this. I think I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life however long it may be. I wish I could kill myself but I know I can't. The only things keeping me going are the hopes that I can have children one day, the fact that a small amount of people would be upset if I died, the feel that I need to live with this intense guilt and pain for the rest of my life, and the slight stupid childish glimmer of hope that I might be able to do something for that baby once more. Even if he's not a baby anymore.

I'm sorry for the rant, but it feels like it's physically destroying me holding it in. I just had to put it somewhere. I just can't hold it in. I never thought my pain could get worse but my God it got so much worse.

Edit: I've been thinking some more. Well, a lot more. Something small some things big. Like, before the baby was born, I was 350 pounds. I love that boy so much that I told myself that I was going to be healthy so I could play with him, be there for him, and so I wouldn't have so many health issues and end up dying too young and hurting him and his mom by doing so. Within a year I was 220. I went a little too far, so then I got back up to 250, but I've managed to stay in pretty good condition. All because of that little boy.

After my ex-fiancee's death, I've also had I guess kind of revelation of sorts. I realize that despite how much of a terrible, abuse filled life that I've had, pushing people away and not making friends has just made it worse. I hope I don't end up forgetting about this or not feeling this in my coming weeks, months, or even years, but I don't want to be antisocial anymore. I want to actually know the feeling to have multiple friends, to have somebody who loves you and who you love back once more. Once I get that love, I don't want to ever let things just happen, I want to be able to actually articulate my emotions, and communicate. I know you can't control when the past gets to you, but I'm going to try my hardest from this point on to not let the past get to me any more than it has. The pain of this event will never go away, and as I always have, since the second I saw her eyes in seventh grade, I will always love her. Even if towards the end she was pretty much indifferent to me. This may be the most pain, or maybe second most pain I've ever had in my life behind her leaving me, but I don't want to find somebody a year down the road and let this not let me be happy.

Wish me luck, and thank you all for the kind words, it truely does make a difference. When you feel you are drowning, even having a single hand reach out to you can make a difference, let alone so many hands reaching out at once.

I stopped seeing doctor and taking medicines because my brother and sister laughed at me and called me “crazy”. My mother tells all her friends and our relatives that I’m useless and lazy.

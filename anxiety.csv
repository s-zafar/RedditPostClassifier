My best friend became a mass murderer. I‚Äôve never been the same since that day.,1354,False,"So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It‚Äôs been several years, about 6, and while I‚Äôll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I‚Äôm just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn‚Äôt help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I‚Äôm pretty sure he either didn‚Äôt want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn‚Äôt even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn‚Äôt do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn‚Äôt realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he‚Äôd try to change the subject. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn‚Äôt even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn‚Äôt feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like ‚Äúoh let‚Äôs smoke a bowl that‚Äôll cheer you up!‚Äù And that was when I had my first panic attack. I‚Äôm talking full on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna die oh my god.‚Äù This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn‚Äôt sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it‚Äôs caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can‚Äôt really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don‚Äôt really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he‚Äôs never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I‚Äôm kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It‚Äôs hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can‚Äôt focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I‚Äôd love to answer, but I‚Äôd also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I‚Äôm in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don‚Äôt deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that‚Äôs stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a ‚Äúhaha I got you‚Äù thing that he loved doing.

",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/9nmosq/my_best_friend_became_a_mass_murderer_ive_never/,"So, this is a really hard topic to talk about for me. It‚Äôs been several years, about 6, and while I‚Äôll forget about what happened, the generalized anxiety it brought still never goes away.   

First off for context, I‚Äôm just gonna show who the serial killer was. It was a pretty big story in my state and really big on YouTube if you spent any time on there in 2012.  

[Mr. Anime](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.texasmonthly.com/articles/disturbing-new-details-emerge-about-man-arrested-in-familys-murder/amp/).       

Anyways, I woke up today with a comment from a video on YouTube that I posted on. It was a web documentary that someone did on him, and I thought it was a nice way to get some of this off my chest. Of course, this really didn‚Äôt help, and I ended up super anxious. People taunting me about it and all sorts of troll behavior you get in YouTube comments.   

A little backstory: I grew up with Trey from the age of 12 until he killed his family when I was 22. I had been in contact and hung out with him up until like 3 months before he did the act. He cut contact with me around then which I‚Äôm pretty sure he either didn‚Äôt want to subject me to that or something.   

When I say we were best friends, I mean we were BEST friends. I spent the night at his house 3 times a week. We had all night WoW gaming sessions, his mom would cook us lunch and dinner so we didn‚Äôt even have to stop raiding. His family was so good to me, they were basically a second family. I was in his first ever YouTube video, and I continued making shorts and sketches with him, and even helped with a couple of his anime reviews when he specialized his channel. 

When he moved to his grandparents house in Hempstead, I visited often, and we made it kind of a party house. He filled his cabinets with liquor and he loved playing the host whenever I came back from college to visit. We definitely indulged in pot and prescription meds, but we were young and stupid. I didn‚Äôt do drugs outside of our weekend chill sessions, and I didn‚Äôt realize he had been addicted to those and alcohol.  

The thing about Trey is he always was pretty secretive. If I ever asked him much about his life or his relationship with his parents, he‚Äôd try to change the subject. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I knew a lot about him, more than his other friends, but it took a lot of work by me to get him to open up. Many a night smoking weed and me opening up about my feelings before he finally did about his dissatisfaction with life, his lack of a higher education, and his fathers disappointment in him. I would always try to cheer him up and make him feel better and it seemed to work.   

When the murders happened, I didn‚Äôt even know what to do. My girlfriend at the time comforted me, but I was just...numb. I literally didn‚Äôt feel anything. Then, my roommate at the time was like ‚Äúoh let‚Äôs smoke a bowl that‚Äôll cheer you up!‚Äù And that was when I had my first panic attack. I‚Äôm talking full on ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna die oh my god.‚Äù This went on for nearly 2 days. Constantly pacing and checking my heart rate. I couldn‚Äôt sleep or eat and felt like I was going insane. I actually packed up and drove to Dallas (I lived in Austin) to go to my moms because I didn‚Äôt know what to do, and she had a Xanax prescription and gave me one and I slept for nearly 20 hours.   

I‚Äôve struggled with anxiety for years now. I learned it‚Äôs caused by PTSD from the events. I have no health insurance so I can‚Äôt really go to therapy unless I foot the entire bill so it really sucks, this is my only way to talk about it honestly other than friends who don‚Äôt really understand. No one really understands. My dad thinks I should just get over it, shit happens, but he‚Äôs never had his fucking best friend kill his second family! A family that was honestly nicer than his real family, who treated him with love and respect and not judgement.  

Anyways, sorry for the erratic writing or if it jumps around a lot. I‚Äôm kind of in a panicked mindset because I got triggered by all the memories of Trey. It‚Äôs hard for me to organize my thoughts when I get into this mindset. It feels like I can‚Äôt focus on any thought and my mind is just swimming and it leaves me confused. If anyone has any questions I‚Äôd love to answer, but I‚Äôd also love some advice and support. 

Thanks for reading.   

Edit; 

Everyone that responded thank you so so much. You have no idea how much this means to me. I‚Äôm in this weird place between joy and guilt that this got so many comments. Joy because I realized people care so much about a random person, and guilt because I feel I don‚Äôt deserve that compassion.  
Yes I know that‚Äôs stupid but that comes with the anxiety sadly. Like others have said, I feel I may have a bit of survivors guilt because I learned I was actually a target of his, and I read and article by someone yesterday where he did an interview with Texas rangers. Supposedly when he was 13 he was considering killing one of his friends. I know that friend was me. I remember that day because we were playing with guns as country kids will do and I remember him aiming in my general direction but kind of doing a ‚Äúhaha I got you‚Äù thing that he loved doing.   

Anyways, I‚Äôm trying to respond to everyone, but I work 11am-11pm the next 2 days (yay service industry). So if I haven‚Äôt responded yet, I will definitely try. I‚Äôll be going back to my inbox and on this post and trying to get to everyone. Thank you for taking the time to share and care seriously. ",9nmosq,Anxiety,136

"Does anyone else constantly feel like the ""pity friend"" and like everyone you know is closer to each other than to you?",1330,False,"This is one of the core issues of my social anxiety. I see the way everyone interacts and there are so many aspects of it that just do not come naturally to me because of how self-conscious I am and how much I try to stay out of everyone's way. People are way physically touchier with each other than they are with me (because being touchy just isn't something I naturally do in platonic relationships, even though I have no problem being touched), people tease each other a lot more and are way better at ~witty banter~ and being sassy with each other than I am and so people treat me weirdly more politely and delicately than they do other people, etc. which like the touching thing is I'm sure just because of how weirdly polite and overly nice I am and they don't want to overstep.

I just always notice that I am treated differently than most, almost like a child to some degree or at least someone who's pretty delicate and sensitive and naive (which I am to some degree, but I think I give off the impression that I am way more than is accurate). I just often end up feeling that I'm only invited to things out of pity more than anything and I somehow self-sabotage and put up boundaries that make it impossible for me to  be as close to others as they are to each other, or at least in the kinds of ways and dynamics with which people usually bond and connect.

I'm not sure how to put all of this into words really, but basically I'm just constantly overanalyzing everyone's behavior and they do treat me differently. They're very NICE, but that's mostly it and that's not really a basis for closeness and comfort with most people. I don't know how to fix it to be more approachable and make people feel more comfortable acting normal with me. I just always feel like I'm not ""in on"" things and just kind of there instead of actually an integral part of any groups.

"This time last year I couldn‚Äôt leave my bedroom because of anxiety, today I talked myself down from a panic attack during a surgical procedure.",1331,False,"I‚Äôm a 22 year old guy and my anxiety was horrible a year ago. I was unemployed, my life ruled by anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt drive, go out with friends, see a movie, and for a while didn‚Äôt leave my room. It got so bad I was severely underweight and stayed in a psych hospital for a few days. I began to see a therapist who did CBT 3 times a week, plus saw a psychiatrist and got on the right medication. 

Now I work in a big hospital operating room as a technician full time, I drive all the time, go on dates, and I start school to be an EMT Monday. Today I was assisting during a gastric bypass. I was fully scrubbed in, holding a camera where I have to be dead still, and it‚Äôs just me and the 2 doctors, all crammed around this patient. It wasn‚Äôt the first time I assisted during this surgery, but it was my first time with this doctor, who‚Äôs notoriously vicious, and at one point shit started to hit the fan. The room got silent, tensions where high, and my anxiety skyrocketed. My mask started to fog up and I was sweating, but I can‚Äôt touch my face and contaminate my gloves, so I was literally trapped. Then I remembered everything I had learned, I started to focus on my breathing and the work the doctor was doing. I thought to myself encouraging thoughts, and within a minute my anxiety dropped back down, and we ended up completing the surgery. The best part? The doctor told me I did a great job, something even the nurses had rarely ever heard him say to someone. 

The point of this post? To look at where I was a year ago, basically bedridden from anxiety. Now I live a very full life and do things that I want to, not that my anxiety lets me do.

I though being awkward, nervous, on-edge, and uncomfortable 24/7 was just my personality.

I have ADHD as well and when I thought maybe that was the cause of some of it, but when I got my adderall prescription, I wasn't magically cured of all my uncomfortableness. I was still a nervous, anxious person who also happened to be able to focus better than I used to.

Two weeks ago, the feelings became stronger than normal. I had aches in my chest for days on end. I was so nervous and on edge--more so than usual.

I didn't think I'd be able to do this (was having 3 to 4 cups of strong coffee and 1-2 sodas per day) but I feel so much better off it. I drink a lot of decaf tea and water. The first week was rough (headaches!) but I powered through and stuck with it. 

2. I stopped going on Facebook altogether. The whole ""comparison"" crap and drama, don't need it.

3. I don't watch the TV news. Ever.

4. I am not overweight, but I started exercising. My therapist told me this is a great treatment for anxiety and he was right. I just do power walk videos on You Tube, nothing fancy.

5. I eat breakfast every day now (was not doing this before) and started eating more fruits and vegetables.

6. My therapist told me to do more things that I enjoy. So with all the time I have since I'm not on Facebook so much, I am reading books. Light fiction, nothing that stresses me out. I also have been trying to do some of those adult coloring books, but sometimes I get anxious about what colors to use or if my picture will looks good (ridiculous, I know), so that's a process.

7. I have the Headspace app and do some mindfulness. This is really challenging for someone with anxiety I think. Sometimes you don't want to be inside your head too much. But I have found the Managing Anxiety series to be really helpful, with the noting strategies and just acknowledging the anxious thoughts without judging them or trying to run away from them.

8. My therapist also told me to do things that build confidence. So I try to focus on things I'm good at, because baking a delicious cake or doing a good job at my work does help me feel better about myself.

9. I can't say enough good things about therapy and my counselor. This is the first time in my life (I'm 40) that I have taken this step and it is incredibly helpful. If you're struggling with anxiety, think about it. I started with my employer's EAP (employee assistance program) which offered 3 free sessions, and then moved on to a ""real"" counselor because it was so helpful. Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

Look into if your work has this as an option, it's free! 


Recognize that anxiety management is a process, and not just a switch we can turn off. My instinct previously was to try to run away from it. I hated it and I was mad at it. But now I understand that it's part of who I am, I have to accept that and I have to learn how to manage it. Hang in there, friends. You got this.

"I decided to fight for net neutrality, even with social anxiety. It has been the easiest thing ever.",1065,False,"I am sure all of you have seen the posts across Reddit about the fight to keep net neutrality, and the FCC upcoming vote to dismantle it. Personally, I feel that we need to keep net neutrality, but you are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. I don't want to get into the politics of it all, but I'm sure you can find that elsewhere on Reddit.

So this is just my story about how it has been going for me to voice my opinion on the matter, even when I get social anxiety. Just picking up the phone and having to talk to another human can be difficult sometimes ‚Äî whether it be calling the store to find what time it closes or having to get support with technology ‚Äî it makes me nervous just thinking about it. So you can imagine what it must feel like to want to voice my opinion ‚Äî something I rarely do as it is because I worry about alienating people or making them upset. Especially when it comes to politics.

The main things that concerned me about calling my local representatives were... What do I say? My representative doesn't share the same political beliefs I do, so are they going to argue with me over the phone? Is there something special I need to do when they pick up? Maybe I should just hang up...

**First off**, I used [this website](http://www.battleforthenet.com), which is an automated system that auto-dials your representatives for you, based on your ZIP code. Plus, it even gives you a basic script you can say. Literally, I said this word for word: ""Hello. I just wanted to call to express my opinion about net neutrality. So... um... yeah, I support 'Title Two' net neutrality rules and I would like you guys to publicly oppose the FCC's plan to repeal them. I would really like if you guys would contact the FCC Chairman and demand that he abandon his current plan. I don't believe we need legislation, so instead we really need you to stop the FCC from getting rid of the existing rules. So um... that's all. Thanks.""

**Secondly**, the dude on the other end of the line is just some staffer ‚Äî often some college kid that takes phone calls for the representative's office. They were practically a robot themselves, and to be honest, they don't care to have a discussion about my political beliefs, even if they don't share them. There wasn't any argument, nor did they say much of anything at all.

**And finally**, I didn't hang up! I stuck with it, and just read the script. When the lackey on the phone was done hearing me out, you can press star (*) on your phone, and boom ‚Äî it hangs up on them, the automated system gave me a pat on the back (seriously, she says, ""You're doing great!""), and it automatically calls the next representative.

-----

At the end of the day, I felt relieved that I did it. I was so anxious about it at first! But when I spoke with these people, they didn't say much of anything, and I didn't feel scared because I realized their whole job is listening to people complain. The guy on the other end of the phone is just some dude who literally listens to calls all day and just forwards your comments to the man or woman in charge. The most that was said to me was when they asked for my address and ZIP code to confirm I lived in their district. That was it.

Long story short: even with my anxiety issues, I found it to be easier than I expected, and it made me feel like I accomplished something.

P.S. My first attempt was in the evening, after my representatives' offices had closed. I did this because I didn't want to talk to someone on the first try. So I just left them messages on their voicemail expressing my opinion, but I found that sometimes their voicemail was full. So I need to try again the next day, because otherwise, I'm not being heard.

**tl;dr:** I expected to feel huge social anxiety calling my representatives to support net neutrality.

I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù, the better I feel.
* It‚Äôs just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What‚Äôs the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don‚Äôt focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don‚Äôt have to do anything.
* It‚Äôs not what I have to do. It‚Äôs what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
* Don‚Äôt be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn‚Äôt be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don‚Äôt have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there‚Äôs nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept¬†the anxiety. Don‚Äôt try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch¬†the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act¬†normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don‚Äôt try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat¬†the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You‚Äôll see that you‚Äôll calm down soon.
* Expect¬†the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don‚Äôt focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!

&#x200B;

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù, the better I feel.
* It‚Äôs just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What‚Äôs the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don‚Äôt focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don‚Äôt have to do anything.
* It‚Äôs not what I have to do. It‚Äôs what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that‚Äôs because that‚Äôs what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn‚Äôt going anywhere.
* Don‚Äôt be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn‚Äôt be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don‚Äôt have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there‚Äôs nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

&#x200B;

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

&#x200B;

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept¬†the anxiety. Don‚Äôt try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch¬†the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act¬†normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don‚Äôt try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat¬†the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You‚Äôll see that you‚Äôll calm down soon.
* Expect¬†the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don‚Äôt focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

Has anyone else been anxious since they were a kid?,1034,False,"Ever since I was young, I've always been super anxious about everything.

If you are browsing and read this please take a moment and do this...,1002,False," A moment to breathe. Take a minute and:
- stretch your back
- get your shoulders back
- unclench your jaw (important one - thank you u/SaltedBiscuitTV)
- relax your muscles and let your body feel its own weight
- wherever you are, imagine that your scenario is imaginary; you are alone and all noise or people are a sort of movie playing around you
- close your eyes (really, just do it)
- imagine you are in your safest place on earth (your bedroom, an island, near the sea...) -- you should do this as a sort of meditation technique, be careful with dissociation symptoms (I suffer from it but it helps to remove myself from the place I am so you do you!) - thanks to u/veraamber
- inhale deeply and hold it for a couple seconds
- exhale as slow as possible...
- repeat 5 or 10 times
- remember that right at this moment there are thousands of people feeling the same exact thing you are now feeling; you are NOT alone, think about it and feel that connection

Later:
- go on about your day and put the phone down when you can and if possible do something nice that calms you down later - you deserve it! Go for an icecream, snuggle in a nice blanket... 

- if you‚Äôre not alone let people know you need a break to feel better, it‚Äôs a great first step if you are ashamed of your anxiety or try to hide it

- when you have time, write down in a really small font size a list of things that make you feel calmer or relaxed (reading, music, whatever) - print it and put it in your wallet or anything you carry around because most of the time we just forget to do those things! 

When you feel overwhelmed, read the list and choose an item and DO it. It‚Äôs easy for us to fall in the trap of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù and never do the things that we *know* calm us down.

I have mine with a list of good things in life/things I enjoy doing/reminders that I‚Äôve struggled for years and... I‚Äôm still here!

Have a good morning/afternoon/night, you are NEVER alone <3

"The ""crazy bitch box"" concept",948,False,"I have a co-worker who knows exactly how to spike my anxiety and those of others in the office.  This is the person who CCs your boss if there's a typo in a \*draft\* document you create (complete with screenshots and red circles), who reports you to the boss if you're 5 minutes late to do a task for her or don't do it fast enough, and who will get in your face and yell at you if you DARE question her.  All in all, a peach to work with. My boss is aware of these issues but he gets the same treatment from her, and at this point has all her daily e-mails (30+) re-routed to spam.

She was in a mood this morning and we had to interact. Cue a 45 minute yelling fit because I dared ask her a scheduling question and because of her 45 minute rant, everything was late, which led to more yelling.  Normally, this gets me very anxious as yelling is a big trigger for me. My anxiety is deeply rooted in my penchant for perfectionism and wanting validation from others. So, I would normally be a mess after this interaction.

But, last week, my therapist introduced me to what she called the ""crazy bitch box"" theory.  When my coworker starts ranting/yelling, I simply imagine placing her in a soundproof box and shutting the door.  This soundproof box is the ""crazy bitch box"" and she stays there. She can rant all she wants while she is in the box, and the box contains her so what she says/does can't hurt me.  By having that visualization, my anxiety about interacting with her is minimized.  85% of what she says gets her placed in the ""crazy bitch box"" and I'm so much calmer because somehow with her in the box, I feel safer.  Plus, the idea of someone stuck in a tiny Plexiglas box makes me giggle.

Hoping this concept might help someone here.

I wanted to share some details from my journey with mental illness and progress.

I am 22F. I have had troubles with substance abuse, anxiety, depression, behavior comparable to cluster b personality disorders, and severe depersonalization-derealization symptoms for quite some time. I‚Äôm a massive hypochondriac and have a horrible fear of flying and being alone.

A few years ago, when I was at my worst, I was using drugs and dropped out of community college twice because I was too afraid to leave my house. I lived with a guy who was really bad for me and who I was very terrible to, and gained 20 pounds in a year. I remember being so severely anxious and depressed that I had to start doing therapy over the phone because I didn‚Äôt want to go out to see my therapist, and if I went outside (something I only did to smoke cigarettes) I couldn‚Äôt look out at the trees or up at the sky because everything was so overwhelming. I thought I‚Äôd never get better, I thought things would only get worse tbh.

Fast forward over the next year, the boyfriend ends up moving out and we have a very dramatic breakup. I begin to have to force myself to drive to run errands, and I grow so lonely that I decide to start seeing friends again‚Äîthey were so welcoming. Over the next few months, I started to pick up the pieces. I moved closer to a city to go to massage school, I got a job, I started dating, got on a plane for my birthday, supported my family through my grandfather‚Äôs palliative care. 

Then I finished massage school, which was a huge triumph for me. I moved to DC, and got my dream job. I met an amazing man and started a new, better relationship. I stopped using drugs, I switched to a significantly better therapist. Tried psychiatrists as well, but ended up not going that route. My boyfriend became my husband when he needed to move to the Middle East for a job and I decided I‚Äôd go with him for some time to enroll in esthetician school there. We moved to Qatar, I picked up exercising and meal prep and ended up at my lowest weight as an adult. I‚Äôve been writing and reading more. I‚Äôm back in school, adding modalities to my work. Still seeing my therapist via teletherapy. Since I moved in August I‚Äôve managed to get on 11 planes and will fly again tonight, though it is still very scary for me I know I can do it. I‚Äôve travelled 7 new countries that I‚Äôd never thought I‚Äôd see, and truly enjoyed it. 

That said, I still have my struggles. I believe I always will; however, the difference in the quality of my life is remarkable. I still have panic attacks sometimes, I still go through extremely obsessive-compulsive behavior and hypochondriasis, I still have DPDR episodes, and I still struggle with impulsive behavior and the relationships in my life‚Äîbut everything is not so severe as it was. 

Yesterday was a new milestone for me and I‚Äôm super stoked about it. My husband and I, on vacation in Iceland, received news that he had to leave immediately for work. We‚Äôd already paid for two flights and accommodations for another day in Iceland, then 2 days in London, so we decided it‚Äôd be best if I took the trip myself. I was TERRIFIED. I‚Äôve never travelled alone internationally, and the last time I flew alone was 4 years ago‚Äîwhich was my worst panic attack on a plane. But I decided to try anyways, and I‚Äôve surprised myself so far.

First anxiety attack in front of boyfriend,944,False,"My boyfriend and I have been friends for nearly 2 years and have been dating for four months. Yesterday was the first time I had an anxiety attack in front of him. He has known that I have anxiety but he's never seen it first hand.

Well yesterday, I was hanging at his place anime on his computer when all of a sudden my anxiety overwhelmed me. I went to his bathroom for a minute hoping it would pass and then I broke down, I realized that I had been in the bathroom for too long so I quickly washed my face and went back out. Even though I had washed my face it couldn't hide the redness and puffiness of my face. 

At first he didn't see it because I was on my phone and hid my face with my hair, and then he laughed and pointed at the screen and looked over at me, immediately paused the show and went ""are you okay?""

That's when I pointed at my chest and through very narrow breaths said ""I'm.... having... an .... anxeity... attack""

He asked why, and when he realized I couldn't talk he grabbed my hand and rubbed methodical circles. 

Throughout the rest of the attack, if I told him not to touch me he'd lay off. If I told him to touch me he'd wrap me in an embrace. He even pointed at me and looked at our dog and said ""Mom's sad. Give her love"" to which our dog jumped on me and gave me dozens of kisses.

I just... aghast. I'm so happy he reacted the way he did. But in my head I thought he would have hated seeing my attack and would've reacted differently. I'm so happy he took it the way he did and I'm surprised as well. 

But goddamn I love that man.

Does anyone get anxiety from feeling like you're wasting your time?,909,False,"I've noticed that a pretty consistent trigger for anxiety is feeling like I'm wasting my time or other people are wasting my time.

However, when I get back from work I find myself aimlessly scrolling through reddit or watching youtube videos. And my heart starts racing more as I become aware of how much time I just wasted. At that point, I feel so panicked that I can't do anything productive OR relaxing.

A cool anxiety technique I learned,908,False,"**Step 1** - Think back to a moment when you were anxious or about a trigger that makes you anxious. If you are actively anxious you can use that as well. 

**Step 2** -Close your eyes and classify that anxiety. Give it a shape, a color or size and then picture it in your mind. Picture it and tell yourself ""This is my anxiety"". 

**Step 3** - Now change that shape in your mind. Warp it, shrink it, change the color to something calmer and send it away. Realize you are in control of how you interpret these feelings and that just as anxiety can enter your mind, it can also leave. 

It's not an end all be all technique but I have found it helpful. This might be kind of weird for some but I've also tried giving anxiety a face in my mind, and then change that expression on the face to a smile. While doing that, also physically smile yourself. Smiling is not something you will typically do while feeling anxious, so just the act of smiling can trick your mind into thinking the stress and anxiety is not needed at this time. 

**Edit:** Since this got bigger I thought I'd provide an example for some people having trouble. For me my anxiety reminded me of a red spikey ball that bounces around my head. What I did was smooth out the ball, shrink it and change it to a nice shade of blue and watched it bounce away and out of mind. 

I think the purpose of this is to distract you slightly and give you a visual representation of something that's hard to define. It helps to see something literally change and show us changing our anxiety is possible!

Do any of you HATE loud sounds?,857,False,"Having anxiety and being afraid of loud sounds is so difficult sometimes. My anxiety is nowhere near as severe as it was a few years back but I'm still a little too highly-strung in my day-to-day life and as a result I pretty much jump right out of my skin whenever there's a sudden noise.

I absolutely hate balloons. If I attend a party and there are balloons on the floor I'll spend the night just waiting for someone to pop one.

Back when I lived in student halls they tested the alarms at the same time every Thursday and I ensured I was never in the building at that time. It was a horrible sound and the idea of being in my room (each room has its own alarm) when it went off made me feel nauseous.

Aced a phone interview and I CAN‚ÄôT STOP SMILING. PHONE ANXIETY SUCKS,825,False,"Three years ago you would‚Äôve never seen me pick up a phone. And in the rare moments I did, I‚Äôd either pass the phone to my family, or I‚Äôd be a stuttering mess and end the phone call hating everything about the call. I‚Äôd blank out on the simplest questions, or overthink every second of silence. It would be a never ending cycle of me flinching whenever my phone rang. 

And then I got to a point where I got tired of it. I was entering university and I couldn‚Äôt even make a phone call for myself without my anxiety getting the best of me. 

So then I asked my friends and family to help. I took it step by step, and just called them for a few seconds. They‚Äôd be there to help me calm myself down enough to be able to think. And then once I started gaining just a little bit of confidence, I pushed myself to make calls to other people. Sure I had to write scripts for every call, and anticipate replies so I could keep writing scripts accordingly, but nonetheless it got me out there. I started making calls. From booking doctors appointments to just calling to ask about food at a restaurant, I did it, and the pride I felt every time after the call was unexplainable. I still had those thoughts though, of the things I could‚Äôve said better, the ways I could‚Äôve changed my tone. But ultimately I reminded myself after each phone call about what I conquered. 

I just hung up a phone call today, from a scheduled phone interview. I didn‚Äôt write a script for it. Instead, I just did everything I would do for a usual job interview, preparing and researching as best I could. And then I just answered the phone call and had a conversation. At points my voice was shaky, but I know I have yet to grow. I ended up getting another interview - in person! Which, to me, is so much easier than the phone, so I‚Äôm hopeful it goes well.

Is it normal to have fun while drinking then feel depressed and over-analyse everything you did when you sober up?,807,False,"Hi guys, i know alcohol is a 'depressant' but I just thought that meant you become more depressed when you drink it, not after.

# Anxiety tip #1 -  Stop consuming caffeine

Caffeine increases the level of a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine in your brain. This neurotransmitter triggers your sympathetic nervous system. Stimulating your fight or flight response is the primary process of the sympathetic nervous system. 

Caffeine also makes your body release adrenaline and depletes your body of the ‚Äòanti-stress vitamin‚Äô B1 (thiamine). For anxious people these things add up quickly, making them feel stressed out and on edge. 

Note: The sensitivity to caffeine varies quite a bit between people. But whether you are sensitive to caffeine or not, **caffeine WILL make you feel more anxious**. It‚Äôs best to avoid caffeine as much as you can. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #2 - Set specific times in your day to be offline

People with anxiety are usually sensitive and easily overstimulated. We might have gotten used to it, but the internet is a pretty hectic place. Your subconsciousness knows that at any time it could see something on the internet that will trigger it. You won't get really deep rest and stress relief if you are always online

**It‚Äôs very important that you create time for yourself every day where you KNOW that you won‚Äôt be disturbed**. Most people don‚Äôt recover well enough from their daily stress. That‚Äôs why our stress accumulates and we end up feeling anxious and on edge more than we need too. We can make sure this stops happening by planning time into our day where we‚Äôll be offline. We should put our phone away and go read a book, meditate, or go for a walk everyday. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #3 - Train yourself to breathe through your stomach

Scientists have recently discovered that humans have group of brain cells whose only function it is to ‚Äòwatch‚Äô our breath. If the breath is slow, deep, and done with our stomach, it signals to the brain that everything is okay. If the breath is fast, shallow, and done with our chest, it signals to the brain that something might be off.

Breathing in your chest is meant for fight or flight situations. It‚Äôs original purpose is to get your body and your mind in a state of readiness by pumping a ton of oxygen into them. 

**Breathing through your stomach has been proven to lower stress and anxiety**. And it‚Äôs actually not that hard to retrain yourself to breath like this all the time! If you learn to breathe through your stomach, you will be decreasing your anxiety automatically, just by breathing. 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #4 - Tie up loose ends

You could do this right now, and it would make a world of difference. We can feel very overwhelmed and anxious because we have so many loose ends in our life. We have mail that we haven‚Äôt opened yet, we have friends we should call, maybe our room needs a good cleaning, or you haven‚Äôt checked your bank statements in 2 months. 

These things are tricky to actually go and do. The longer we procrastinate, the more anxiety we build up around them. But biting the bullet and doing all these things will reduce your anxiety a lot. It might spike your anxiety while you‚Äôre doing it. But when it‚Äôs done you‚Äôll feel much better and lighter. **The less we have on our mind, the less anxious we‚Äôll feel.** 

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #5 - Exercise at least twice a week

Now most of us know that exercise is healthy and works well to reduce anxiety. But a lot of us don‚Äôt realise just how critical exercise is. In his ‚Äò*Anxiety and Phobia workbook*‚Äô  E.J. Bourne says **his clients reported exercise to be the most effective thing for reducing their anxiety.** 

Exercise is a natural outlet for the body's fight or flight mode. There are many proven benefits to regular exercise. Among them are reduced insomnia, increased self-esteem, and greater sense of control over anxiety. 

Pro Tip: Exercise that targets your larger muscles, like running, swimming, and cycling, are found to be the most effective for countering anxiety

&#x200B;

# Anxiety tip #6 - Be in flow

Athletes call this state ‚Äòbeing in the zone‚Äô, Psychologists refer to it as flow. It‚Äôs a state where you forget the time and whatever is going on around you. If you are in flow you are totally absorbed in what you are doing. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who came up with the concept, describes the 8 characteristics of flow as follows:

1. Complete **concentration** on the task
2. **Clarity of goals** and reward in mind and immediate feedback
3. Transformation of **time** (speeding up/slowing down of time)
4. The experience is intrinsically **rewarding**
5. **Effortlessness** and ease
6. There is a balance between **challenge and skills**
7. Actions and awareness are merged, **losing self-conscious rumination**
8. There is a feeling of **control** over the task

Flow makes you temporarily free from your anxiety in a healthy way. It makes you more calm throughout your day and gives you something to look forward too. Find something that puts you in a state of flow and make sure you do it at least once or twice a week. It will make a big difference in in your life satisfaction.

Most people grab their phone the second they wake up. This is about worst thing you can do to start your day. It‚Äôs very important we start our day on our own terms. We should let no influence from the outside bother us for at least the first hour of your day.

**Breathing through your stomach has been proven to lower stress and anxiety**. And it‚Äôs actually not that hard to retrain yourself to breath like this all the time! If you learn to breathe through your stomach, you will be decreasing your anxiety automatically, just by breathing.

# Anxiety tip #4 - Tie up loose ends

You could do this right now, and it would make a world of difference. We can feel very overwhelmed and anxious because we have so many loose ends in our life. We have mail that we haven‚Äôt opened yet, we have friends we should call, maybe our room needs a good cleaning, or you haven‚Äôt checked your bank statements in 2 months. 

These things are tricky to actually go and do. The longer we procrastinate, the more anxiety we build up around them. But biting the bullet and doing all these things will reduce your anxiety a lot. It might spike your anxiety while you‚Äôre doing it. But when it‚Äôs done you‚Äôll feel much better and lighter. **The less we have on our mind, the less anxious we‚Äôll feel.**

# Anxiety tip #5 - Exercise at least twice a week

Now most of us know that exercise is healthy and works well to reduce anxiety. But a lot of us don‚Äôt realise just how critical exercise is. In his ‚Äò*Anxiety and Phobia workbook*‚Äô  E.J. Bourne says **his clients reported exercise to be the most effective thing for reducing their anxiety.** 

Exercise is a natural outlet for the body's fight or flight mode. There are many proven benefits to regular exercise. Among them are reduced insomnia, increased self-esteem, and greater sense of control over anxiety. 

Pro Tip: Exercise that targets your larger muscles, like running, swimming, and cycling, are found to be the most effective for countering anxiety

# Anxiety tip #6 - Be in flow

Athletes call this state ‚Äòbeing in the zone‚Äô, Psychologists refer to it as flow. It‚Äôs a state where you forget the time and whatever is going on around you. If you are in flow you are totally absorbed in what you are doing. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the psychologist who came up with the concept, describes the 8 characteristics of flow as follows:

1. Complete **concentration** on the task
2. **Clarity of goals** and reward in mind and immediate feedback
3. Transformation of **time** (speeding up/slowing down of time)
4. The experience is intrinsically **rewarding**
5. **Effortlessness** and ease
6. There is a balance between **challenge and skills**
7. Actions and awareness are merged, **losing self-conscious rumination**
8. There is a feeling of **control** over the task

Flow makes you temporarily free from your anxiety in a healthy way. It makes you more calm throughout your day and gives you something to look forward too. Find something that puts you in a state of flow and make sure you do it at least once or twice a week. It will make a big difference in in your life satisfaction.

"This is to all the people who are jobless, skipping classes, or completely hopeless in life because of anxiety disorders",765,False,"My life is far, very far from perfect. But I want to share something.

I graduated high school in 2014. I was a terrible student. I skipped classes like nobody else did. Not because I am ‚Äúlazy‚Äù, but because my anxiety was so high that it totally hindered my ability to stay in class. 

After I graduated, I spent 2015 and 2016 housebound. Agoraphobic,  depressed and fucked up, with no perspective in life. I never imagined I could even enter the room where an university entrance exam would be applied. And I mean it. I couldn‚Äôt imagine myself there. I couldn‚Äôt even go to the supermarket that is literally in front of my house. 

A miracle happened by the end of 2016. I decided to take an exam, just to TRAIN. To see if I could stay locked in a room with other people for hours. I never expected to pass the exam. I never expected be able to get into the *best university of the continent I‚Äôm from*. I still don‚Äôt believe in it... kind of. 2017 was like a dream or something to me. I still can‚Äôt believe I made it.

I still have problems. Many problems. I am still anxious, and my anxiety is still an obstacle in my daily routine. However...

I am not hopeless anymore. I can look to the horizon and see a brighter future. I can see myself graduating, I can see myself in a job, and I can see myself slowly getting more socially confident. I feel I can make it.

I spent three years hiding in my apartment and then moved to Manhattan.,758,False,"I spent three years in an apartment only going outside for food and other necessities. I played video games all day and watched youtube videos and made art. Minimal social interaction. I've been diagnosed with anxiety since I was 13. 

This past December, I got an email from a creative director at a NYC advertising agency out of the blue and he offered me an internship based on some of the art I posted online.

I flew out there and finished the internship. I was scared shitless on the plane and leading up to the whole thing. 

But I did it. I fucking did it. I was in the busiest, loudest, most faced pased city in America. I had to ride the subway packed full of hundreds of people. I had to interact with producers and directors. I had deadlines.

Somehow, somewhere the courage to accomplish this task was deep inside of me. And I just want to say if I can do it, you can do it. It's possible. Things do change. You are not forever trapped in your anxiety. 

My challenge for you today is to get out of your comfort zone. 

Try something new. Try something different. Even if it's the smallest thing you can think of. Try it. You will be suprised what the human brain is capable of.

I hope I inspired at least one of you today. If it did, posting my story has been a success. Good luck to you. You can do it.

Too tired and anxious to leave my bed. Angry and frustrated at myself for staying in bed. Feeling guilty for not doing anything and wasting time. More anxiety.

To everyone else going through the same thing, I hear you friends, keep going.

‚ÄúThanks for the responses everyone. For those asking, I‚Äôm usually fairly good at dealing with this, I‚Äôm on medication, I‚Äôve had therapy, I‚Äôm knowledgeable about mental health (I‚Äôm a social worker), I help my friends and clients through similar things.

It‚Äôs a hole I‚Äôve fallen down many times before and always found my way out eventually, but it‚Äôs like each time I think ‚Äòthis is the one time I won‚Äôt beat it‚Äô.

What I did that helped me out of bed today was decide I would do ONE SMALL THING only. Which was to walk 10 mins to the shop to buy oranges. It took me hours to make myself go, but I did, and I felt better for it. I was overwhelmed with all the things I SHOULD be doing and couldn‚Äôt start anything, but decided to be kind to myself and say that just doing that small thing was enough. I‚Äôm back at home and don‚Äôt want to go out again and will probably get into bed again and I still feel awful. But I have oranges now.

From what I‚Äôve read, it‚Äôs a positive feedback loop, doing one tiny thing gives you a dopamine boost, which is the motivation neurotransmitter, this then makes you feel more able to do another small thing, and so you build up and eventually hopefully can do more.

I have a job interview for a promotion today!,713,False,"Send good vibes my way please! ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòäüòÅ

Update: thank you so much everyone for the positive messages! I walked in feeling super confident, but.... 

I did not get the job. It turns out that I was vastly unprepared for the interview and I had no idea. The interviewer (internal promotion) explained to me that other applicants had gone to the location of the available job (store site) and spoke with different employees they would be working with, requested detailed financial statements and wrote up 90 day day-by-day plans for the store. 

Looking back now it seems obvious, but having been a temporary employee of that store when they were short staffed I figured I already had an insight to it and the day to day operations. I had asked a senior employee who has had the position I was interviewing for what I needed to do to prepare and he never mentioned any of these things. I know he didn‚Äôt do it maliciously, he‚Äôs a very scatterbrained person and was hand picked for the roll rather than going though the application process. 

Lucky for me my company wants employees who are eager to grow. The interview turned into a discussion about my current location and what is expected of me the next time I apply for a promotion.

Update: thank you so much everyone for the positive messages! I walked in feeling super confident, but.... 

I did not get the job. It turns out that I was vastly unprepared for the interview and I had no idea. The interviewer (internal promotion) explained to me that other applicants had gone to the location of the available job (store site) and spoke with different employees they would be working with, requested detailed financial statements and wrote up 90 day day-by-day plans for the store. 

Looking back now it seems obvious, but having been a temporary employee of that store when they were short staffed I figured I already had an insight to it and the day to day operations. I had asked a senior employee who has had the position I was interviewing for what I needed to do to prepare and he never mentioned any of these things. I know he didn‚Äôt do it maliciously, he‚Äôs a very scatterbrained person and was hand picked for the roll rather than going though the application process. 

Lucky for me my company wants employees who are eager to grow. The interview turned into a discussion about my current location and what is expected of me the next time I apply for a promotion.

"Deactivated fb, it was damaging me mentally. No one has even noticed!",700,False,"Last Saturday morning, I deactivated fb (with a view to letting it delete after however long it takes). I found that despite 400+ 'friends', I actually wasn't enjoying it at all anymore.

It's not helping my mental health in the slightest. It has to go.

It is, admittedly, somewhat cathartic and liberating to no longer be a part of that social media network. I still have the ability to use messenger, so can still talk to people. But I think what's hurt a little more is literally only one person has noticed I'm no longer active on there. Which I suppose really hits home how insignificant my online presence was.

I feel very lonely. Friends that used to message me daily no longer message at all, and if I message them, it just gets left on 'read'. There are only so many times I can try, before I stop because clearly they won't respond.

There were so many of those friends that consistently would post / share memes etc about depression, anxiety; suicide. About how much they care and how we should all reach out if we haven't heard from someone in a while. The irony is, no one has. And despite not wanting to believe it, I don't think anyone will.

I work, I go home, walk / feed / play with my dog, then go to bed. I'm usually in bed by 8.30pm (up at 6am) because there seems little to stay awake for anymore.

What people think is a cure for anxiety is actually one of its causes.,700,False,"When I am feeling anxious and am searching the internet for advice I often come across some form of this:

""Understand that your anxiety is illogical and that you aren't actually in danger""

Suggesting that if you realize this, the anxiety will go away. In my experience it is the exact opposite. Just feeling anxious is one thing. I've felt anxious before big events, it's not pleasant, but if I don't fight it, it comes and goes and I move on. But feeling anxious and knowing you shouldn't be is where the problems really start. When I am anxious and know I shouldn't be, I worry that something is wrong with me and that adds to my anxiety. I can stay like this for weeks or months and I only seem to be able to break the cycle when something especially good happens and I get distracted enough to stop rejecting how I am feeling.

In the last year I have had considerable success overcoming anxiety by accepting it when it comes. This is way harder than it sounds. It's like flexing a muscle you didn't know you had. When I start feeling anxious, I make the conscious effort to accept how I'm feeling. I can't pull it off all the time, but I'm getting better and better at it. The trick is that you have to really believe it. You have to decide that how you are feeling is completely acceptable. You can't trick yourself and ""accept"" your anxiety in the hope that it will go away. You have to really be OK with it sticking around, and just like that it will be gone. It will come back, but you will be building up a skill that will allow you to once again let it pass.

My therapist of 4 years just passed away... I want to celebrate him. He helped me through my worst years.,693,False,"This isn't a post about being anxious due to my clinical psychologist dying. It is a celebration of what he meant to me and a celebration of all the therapist out there that are making a difference. 

My therapist's name was Louis. When I met him, nearly 4 years ago, I was at a bad place in my life. I had been suffering from the effects of Anxiety Disorder for nearly 13 years, and visiting my GP monthly for over a year, when I asked her for a recommendation for a therapist. She gave me Louis' number and the number of 3 other therapists.

After delaying for weeks, I called all of the referrals I was given. Two weren't taking new patients, one wasn't returning my calls and the 4th was Louis. What are the chances that I would like the only Therapist that would see me? (well, 100%)

I was really nervous about meeting Louis because I had never been to therapy before. I had no idea what to expect. Would he judge me? Would he yell at me? Would he humiliate me? Would he intimidate me into taking action? I wasn't sure, but decided that I was willing to try.

Louis was a short Jewish man that reminded me of the actor Saul Rubinek (Warehouse 13) with a trendier, gray, beard. He had a very soft way of communicating that made you feel instantly comfortable. After meeting him once, I knew that we were going to get along. Sometimes in life, you just click with people instantly. This is how it was with Louis and me. :)

As I went to each session, I discovered that Louis and I had tons in common: we experienced many of the same issues. So his recommendations felt tailored to me. In a way, talking to Louis was like talking to an older version of myself. We had different upbringings, I was raised Catholic and he was raised Jewish, but there we so many parallels between our lives that he would instantly be able to tell me his version of my story and how he dealt with it. This was the reinforcement I needed to prove to myself that everything was going to be okay. I was in good hands.

Don't get me wrong, not every session in 4 years was pleasant. But every session was productive. He knew how to see past my BS. He knew how to get to the core of the issue. And the amazing thing was that the days that I thought I had nothing to talk about were the days that we made the most progress.

Basically, when you don't think you have anything to talk about, it's usually because you have been trained to see past your BS. This means that you can actually start making some significant forward movements. 

Now, after 4 years of treatment. I am feeling fantastic and it is thanks to Louis. My goal when I started therapy was as follows:

To be myself without reservation, without shame, and without apology. 

Louis helped me to do these things by supporting the work I did as a vlogger. He helped me to talk publically about dealing with anxiety. He helped me to turn my weakness into a super power.

Now...

Today, while on a hike, I found out that Louis had passed away via the internet. I hadn't heard from him in few weeks and decided to give his office call. His message had been replaced with a referral service. I instantly typed ""Obituary Louis..."" and discovered that he had passed away 3 days ago, and I had just missed his funeral earlier in the day. 

The feelings came rushing in, but there was no Anxiety. It was just a combination of sadness and joy. As I walked through the park, I cried and laughed - I must have looked like a crazy person. 

I cried because I lost a great friend. I laughed because I was full of joyful gratitude. He saved my life. And, to me, gratitude is displayed as laughter with tears.

I decided that, while I missed his funeral, that I would place flowers at his office door. His office was right next door to a supermarket; so I ran in and got some flowers and a card. I quickly returned to my car and added the line... ""Louis was a blessing in my life.""

I exit my car and head towards the building only to be accosted by a parking attendant for the supermarket, ""You can't park here..."". I turn with flowers in hand, ""My friend is dead, I just want to show him some respect."" 

We argued a little and I told the attendant, in a frustrated tone, ""Fine! I will move my car!"" I could tell that he was kind of regretting telling me to move the car, due to the circumstances, but I just didn't have the time or energy.

I ran up the stairs to Louis' office, placed the flowers and the card at the door, and returned to my car. All I could think of is that Louis would have wanted me to apologize to the parking attendant. 

I drove toward the attendant... He looked me in the eye as I approached. Probably thinking I was going to flip him off or something. But I channelled my friend and said, ""I want to apologize. I was a jerk to you. My friend died and I am a little upset. But he trained me to see when I am spreading my pain around. You were just doing your job."" 

The attendant told me, ""I am feeling really bad about this..."" I told him ""I am sorry for making you feel bad, but I am grateful to you because you have helped me to see that the lessons, that my friend taught me, will always be with me. 

Louis will always be with me, as my shoulder angel.

Thank you Louis. 
I love you!

posting on Reddit gives me anxiety - so this is me fighting that anxiety,682,False,"I have been a lurker on Reddit, and many other sites on the internet for many years now. It took me years until I could even bring myself to make a Reddit account (and other accounts.) However, I could not bring myself to post anything or any comments no matter how badly I wanted to. In the past, I have posted a few things when I had been feeling brave enough to overcome my anxiety, but I always go back into hiding.

The internet, and Reddit, is supposed to offer a free medium for people to freely express and share their ideas, creations, thoughts, and opinions. Despite amazing, silly, and positive things happening on Reddit everyday, on social media there is social pressure. People wishing to get validation from others (karma, gold, upvotes, etc.) Trolls, negativity, people fighting for the top comment or post.
Before I even wrote this I researched and found several older /r/Anxiety posts about the same topic, and even a whole article describing how I felt.

Even though I tell myself that I don't care about validation from others, that I don't care about what others think or being judged, I still get anxiety. In the back of my mind, I still have fear that whatever I have to say or do is not worth expressing. That someone has said it before, or that its unoriginal, or that it simply isn't good enough. That all of my thoughts are invalid. And because of that I shouldn't even try. Better nothing than a negative outcome.

On top of subconsciously fearing others, I fear myself. That whatever I have to say will never be perfect enough or amount to enough. That my high expectations will never be met anyway so why even try.
All throughout my school life, I have also struggled to complete anything (anything that involves writing or artistic projects) because of anxiety. It was either 100% or 0%. Which was not a healthy way of doing anything.  This post in itself is being written and re-written for weeks now.

But at the moment, I am writing this post to try to battle those thoughts in my head. Something, anything, is better than nothing. This post is to tell my anxiety that it doesn't matter who reads this post or how I write it, just the fact that I did it. That it doesn't matter if what I write or do is perfect, or the best or the worst, or way too long, but that it exists. And that my thoughts are valid because they exist. 
As long as am I alive, I am going to keep trying to find the courage to express myself and allow those thoughts to exist. Reddit is just one small way of doing so.

Be aware of your distorted thinking,678,False,"In general, there are 6 types of distorted thoughts that lead to anxiety.

Personally, being aware of these types of distorted thoughts helps me to identify which of my thoughts are anxiety and which of my thoughts are valid. Being able to identify anxious thinking is the first step in dealing with it. 

1) **Probability Overestimations**- Exaggerated beliefs about the chances of a negative event or outcome happening. 

Examples: Thinking that there is a high chance of dying in a plane crash. Assuming that your best friend doesn't like you anymore because they didn't respond to your text right away. Most ""What if..."" type thoughts. 

2) **All or Nothing Type Thinking**- Black/White thought patterns, judging everything as good or bad without recognizing that life is, in fact,  mostly ""grey area"". Judging something as negative when it is actually neutral. This type of thinking plays a big part for people that struggle with perfectionism. 

Examples: Interpreting someones neutral facial expressions as negative because they aren't obviously happy- ""If it's not positive than it must be negative"". -On diet> eat cupcake> think diet in now ruined> proceed to eat entire XL pizza & wings b/c your diet is ""ruined"" anyway due to the cupcake. 

3) **Catastrophic Thinking**- Exaggerating the importance of an event or outcome. (Not to be confused with point #1: probability overestimation, although the two are intimately related.) Underestimating your ability to cope in the unlikely event that the ""worst possible case"" does come true.  

Example: ""If this first date doesn't go well I will probably die alone with 80 cats."" When in reality, if the date doesn't go well it holds no power over the rest of your life. In reality, 5 minuets after the date is over, it doesn't matter anymore.

""It will ruin my life if my new coworkers don't like me"" When in reality, even if they hate you, you can always get a new job, or even be professionally successful without having a personal relationship with your colleagues. 

4) **Personalization**- Blaming yourself and only yourself for negative situations. 

Example ""That was an awkward conversation because I am awkward"". When in reality the other person has 50% responisibilty for the conversation.

5) **Mind Reading**- Making assumption about what others think. 

Example: ""That server was a dick to me because she doesn't like me"" when in reality she was just in a bad mood because her husband cheated on her. 

6) **Selective Attention and Memory**- This is the tendency to focus on information that is consistent with your beliefs. If you believe that the world is dangerous or that people don't like you or that you are unworthy etc etc, your brain will pay attention to ""evidence"" that is consistent with your beliefs. Kind of like how you always notice cars on the road that are the same as yours. 

Example: You notice the 3 people who you perceived to look negative during your presentation and ignore the 15 that looked positive or neutral. Or worse, you perceived the neutral to be negative (see point #2).

Anyone else with anxiety have a crippling fear of confrontation?,664,False,"34 year old male, diagnosed with generalized and social anxiety.

I would actually say the worst symptom of anxiety for me is a fear of confrontation.  Even when I'm 100% in the right, having to call someone out on their bullshit can be enough to induce a panic attack.

Then, I wind up even more pissed off and upset because I end up letting someone walk all over me and then my anxiety gets even worse, or I just shut down and get super depressed.

"Exercise... seriously, do it.",662,False,"I have battled anxiety for nearly ten years now. I‚Äôve been on and off antidepressants (been off almost two years).

I‚Äôm so happy I could cry! So there I was, at Starbucks, I had too much caffeine (which I shouldn‚Äôt truly be consuming to begin with) and I feel a panic attack coming on and coming on strong. 

Usually I try to shove it down. It never works but I still do it until I inevitably spiral.

But there was this barista sweeping by me. He and I had spoken a few times before this visit and I recalled him saying he was taking a summer course at the nearby community college.

I had my earphones in, trying to listen to music and shakily eat a bagel to calm down. I have social anxiety and have been trying to do some things to get over that these past few weeks such as, smiling when I make eye contact with people and attempting to have casual conversations. 

But there I was, debating whether or not I should even try casually talking to this guy in the midst of forcing back a panic attack and a strong urge to cry. After about a minute (maybe a few, not sure it felt like eternity though) I just turned my head to face him and did it! I asked him how his class was going and although I was very shaky (vocally and physically), we ended up having a great conversation. 

We briefly touched on my anxiety. I even lightheartedly made a joke about choosing whether to have a bagel or panic attack and I seriously don‚Äôt know how this didn‚Äôt kill the conversation. I wish I could remember what he said afterwards or how the conversation kept flowing. Somehow we ended up talking about a bunch of things.

"Anyone else with ""high functioning"" anxiety?",662,False,"Don't mean to rank forms of anxiety, which is why I used the scare quotes - 

I saw three or four therapists who told me, ""wow, sounds like you're doing really well!"" before seeing one who took my anxiety seriously. I'm always early to things, I'm an ""exceeds expectations"" performer at my job, recently finished grad school with a solid GPA, have a great relationship with my significant other and my family, and I just feel all kinds of BAD most of the time.

Anyway, CBT didn't work super well and as nice as my therapist was, they were too expensive/didn't take insurance, so I'm just managing by myself. It's not going super well.

Anyone else in a similar boat? What are you doing that helps you feel better? Since finishing grad school, I plan to try and find a treatment plan depending on my PCP's recommendations.

A dumb (but useful!) little anxiety trick.,647,False,"Tl;dr I have a method for remembering that I did something, so I won‚Äôt be worrying all day about whether or not I did it, and worrying about the consequences of forgetting to have done it.


Ok so sometimes before work I use my hair straightener. I‚Äôm usually in a rush and have to unplug it before I go on my way, of course. But sometimes more often than not I‚Äôd be at work freaking out that I *forgot* to unplug it, freaking out that my house was currently burnt to bits, a pile of ash and debris on my lawn.

So I end up texting my mother (who I live with) asking her to please check that I unplugged it. The thing is, more often than not, I did. In fact I almost always do, and if I don‚Äôt, *it shuts off automatically anyway*. Yet I still find myself at work stricken with anxiety, wondering if I unplugged my hair straightener.

It‚Äôs an outlandish thing to be so worried about, considering I usually unplug it and it shuts off itself anyway, but my google search is still filled with ‚Äúchances of my house burning down from hair straightener‚Äù ‚Äúhow long do automatic shut-off hair straighteners stay on‚Äù ‚Äúhair straightener fire‚Äù... it‚Äôs not good.

Then recently I decided I needed something to remind me, concretely, that I did unplug it in the mornings when I do. So this is going to sound kind of silly or stupid, but now in the mornings when I unplug it I say, out loud, ‚ÄúI am unplugging my hair straightener‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt know why it works. Maybe because I say it out loud and hear it back to me and that reassures me. Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a strange action (saying what you‚Äôre doing out loud to nobody) that makes me remember that I did it. I have no idea, but once I started doing this I no longer doubt whether I unplugged my hair straightener, the memory sticks in my mind and I can relax.

So I thought I would inform the people on r/anxiety about it to see if they do anything similar, or could maybe benefit from this.

It‚Äôs an outlandish thing to be so worried about, considering I usually unplug it and it shuts off itself anyway, but my google search is still filled with ‚Äúchances of my house burning down from hair straightener‚Äù ‚Äúhow long do automatic shut-off hair straighteners stay on‚Äù ‚Äúhair straightener fire‚Äù... it‚Äôs not good.

Then recently I decided I needed something to remind me, concretely, that I did unplug it in the mornings when I do. So this is going to sound kind of silly or stupid, but now in the mornings when I unplug it I say, out loud, ‚ÄúI am unplugging my hair straightener‚Äù.

I don‚Äôt know why it works. Maybe because I say it out loud and hear it back to me and that reassures me. Maybe it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a strange action (saying what you‚Äôre doing out loud to nobody) that makes me remember that I did it. I have no idea, but once I started doing this I no longer doubt whether I unplugged my hair straightener, the memory sticks in my mind and I can relax.

So I thought I would inform the people on r/anxiety about it to see if they do anything similar, or could maybe benefit from this. Perhaps this would fall under more of an OCD thing but I‚Äôve only ever been prescribed with anxiety so I‚Äôm not sure that would apply. But yeah, hope you enjoyed reading about my insanity.",a66bo9,Anxiety,656

"Your feelings are uncomfortable, but they are not dangerous.",638,False,"You have a choice when it comes to your feelings. Your body is releasing stress hormones because it thinks you are in danger because you have trained it to think it is in imminent danger. 

I know, because I trained my mind and body to do the same thing.

Choose which thoughts you follow. When the negative thoughts come, let them come but just don‚Äôt follow them because they too are a bluff. A pattern you have fallen into.

If you want something to remind yourself that it‚Äôs a bluff, like a prescribed emergency medication or a recording or a mantra or whatever, use it, but accept your feelings and choose your thoughts. You have that power, it‚Äôs just buried under anxious nerves.


Full disclosure, I‚Äôve always been anxious as long as I remember. I‚Äôve been medicated for about 7 years now but have never attended therapy (working on it, American healthcare and all that).

I had a panic attack one week ago. It was bad, I vomited. And like the previous attacks, every day since I have woken up only to have a feeling of dread and tension in my arms wash over me. But I am learning to accept these feelings for what they are: a bluff.

my method for sleeping with anxiety,632,False,"It's no joke. This sub lights up like a Christmas tree at night. With some forms of anxiety, trying to fall asleep is the absolute worst. I've been battling it for many years and I think I have found one way that works for me.

Staying busy (mentally) is the best way to keep anxiety at bay so when we stay busy physically, we can manage. At night, the ""busy"" goes away, so our brains start churning. These thoughts lead to physical changes in our bodies that make us feel like total shit and make it hard to sleep.  i.e. increased heart rate, tension grinding, stomach pain...etc. 

We can't control the physical stuff so we have to start with the mental stuff. You have to learn to manage your thoughts. Sounds impossible, right? It's possible with practice. Here is what I do. 

You HAVE to avoid anything personal to you. I imagine a giant house. Imagine entering this house. The first floor is a long hallway full of doors. Behind each door is all the stuff you can think about that has no personal attachment to you. Television shows you watch, movies, word games, number games (stay away from music because it tends to cause memory recall to something personal) 

The trick is to STAY ON THE FIRST FLOOR. 

The second floor is anything personal to you. Friends, family, job, school, tasks, money. All these things can trigger anxiety, regret, stress. If you catch yourself thinking about something on the second floor. Back out immediately. 

The basement is the dark place. All your worst fears. Avoid at all cost. 

As for thoughts that are not personal. You will find tricks that work for you. Some things I do...

Take my favorite movie and put myself in it. I imagine myself in all the situations with all the characters and what I would say with them. Same for favorite tv shows. What would I say to each and every character if I had the chance? 

Word games. I try to come up with every word that is two letters only. I come up with words made from another word. Stupid things like that. 

Eventually, you fall asleep. 

I understand this whole thing sounds ridiculous and crazy but the trick is to not touch on anything personal to you.

"Co-workers were down playing anxiety yesterday. Pisses me off when I hear ""everybody has some kind of anxiety.""",626,False,"To clarify, I don't have anxiety. But my husband does. I've seen first hand what it can do to someone. 

At work yesterday (I'm at a salon) my co-workers were gossiping about some former co-worker of theirs and talking about how much of an attention whore she was and how she's nothing but crazy and drama. Apparently this person is currently asking for money on a go fund me page so that she can get a companion dog. She also says that he would need training to help her with her panic attacks, night terrors, and bringing her medicine to her. I thought to myself, what's the big deal? 

But then they started saying things like ""oh she just wants attention,"" ""everybody has some form of anxiety,"" etc. I piped in and explained that things like panic disorder were a real problem for some people and that it's more than just everyday anxiety. The response I got was ""well we know this girl, she just wants  attention. ""Nobody with actual anxiety would actually tell other people about it."" 

Now I don't even know this person they were talking about. Maybe she does just want attention. But maybe, just maybe, she is desperate at this point and is finally reaching out about her problem. Maybe a go fund me isn't the most practical approach, but it makes me so angry whenever people act like mental health is no big deal or just a way to get attention.

Apparently this person is currently asking for money on a go fund me page so that she can get a companion dog. She also says that he would need training to help her with her panic attacks, night terrors, and bringing her medicine to her. I thought to myself, what's the big deal? 

But then they started saying things like ""oh she just wants attention,"" ""everybody has some form of anxiety,"" etc. I piped in and explained that things like panic disorder were a real problem for some people and that it's more than just everyday anxiety. The response I got was ""well we know this girl, she just wants  attention. ""Nobody with actual anxiety would actually tell other people about it."" 

Now I don't even know this person they were talking about. Maybe she does just want attention. But maybe, just maybe, she is desperate at this point and is finally reaching out about her problem. Maybe a go fund me isn't the most practical approach, but it makes me so angry whenever people act like mental health is no big deal or just a way to get attention. I see the stories you guys post here. I have seen my own husband's anxiety and how it affects him. This shit sucks, and it's real. ",8f26yk,Anxiety,679

Friday my psychologist told me it was time to go out. She said I was causing myself to get worse by being scared of the outside world. I get anxiety just from having delivery people come to my door. Just the thought of going for a drive seemed like an impossibility.

Today I woke up anxious. Even after I took my medication, I was on pins and needles. I was dreading every second that went by, knowing I was closer to our(my fiance and mines) 3pm departure time. We chose that time specifically so the restaurant would be nearly empty. At 3 o'clock I started stalling and coming up with reasons why I couldn't go. At 3:45 he pushed me out the door and all but dragged me to the car.

The ride there was scary but I forced myself to just listen to his voice and not hide my eyes. I felt nauseous. When we pulled into the parking lot and He pulled me from the car, he hugged me and told me this will be fun and I am safe and he will protect me. We got inside the thankfully almost empty diner.

My fiance held my hand and just made small talk, making me start to laugh. I was able to relax a bit and even ate my sandwich! I was anxious, but I didn't feel like I was going to pass out or cry.

"American politics is REALLY fucking with me, and it's making it hard to be around my family.",606,False,"I live in North Carolina.  I went to college, initially, for political science and economics, but about 3/4 of the way through that switched to education and biology because my gut told me to GTFO.

In high school, I took AP history and AP government and politics and fell in love with America's founding principles, the political system's design (and intent), and being able to have spirited, informative debates with my peers.  I was at Barack Obama's inauguration with my AP G&P class, and it was wonderful.  One of the most amazing things I've ever witnessed.

But here's the thing...  I was ultra, ridiculously, lick-Ann-Coulter's-asshole conservative during that time.  I had grown up in a trite Republican household in the rural south with traditional right-wing values and a lot of Jesus.  My grandparents are also very conservative.  Fox News was *always* on.

Things quickly began changing when I moved to Raleigh for college.  More racial and religious diversity, time away from Fox News, I discovered Reddit...  And then some personal things happened, as well.  I started having mood swings regularly, I had my first panic attack, I developed epilepsy, I was frequently in the hospital, I had no money...  I got pregnant and had an abortion.

All of this was very eye-opening.  I learned sympathy and empathy really quickly.  It was easy to be politically conservative when I was pretty much totally ignorant to the realities that most people face every day.  But going through all of that changed my view completely.  Suddenly, I saw why people needed government assistance for food, healthcare, transportation, and housing.  I understood why a woman should be free to make a choice about having an abortion (if that pregnancy didn't kill me due to my epilepsy, the child would have had major defects due to the medications I was on at the time).

NOW, though...  Look at what is going on in the US.  Every time I think shit has hit the fan, someone reaches into the shit-bucket again.  It makes me so anxious.  My healthcare is going to be fucked with, I wouldn't be surprised if ADA got dismantled, women's rights are being stripped away...  Not to mention how racial minorities are being fucked.  I might be getting screwed for being a woman, but at least I'm white...

My parents, especially my father, love *all of this.*  I've been spending a lot of time with them following my hospitalization earlier this year from February-April.  Every time I'm there, if the TV is on, it's on Fox News.  If my dad's around, he won't shut up about how *wonderful* Trump is (without giving any real reasons), he says insanely racist things, talks about how people with disabilities are just exaggerating, etc.  It makes me pissed initially, but then I just become anxious because it's so upsetting to see and hear.  Does he think *I'm* faking it, with my multiple suicide attempts and scar-covered body???

He's even got a signed picture of Trump and Melania up on the refrigerator from during the campaign when he donated to them.  Even if I was still conservative, I would've taken that shit down early last year--and, in retrospect, things were mild at that time.

He asks for my opinions, more than likely, to try to confirm how he feels.  He'll loudly commentate on whatever story Fox has on at the time, blame a minority or liberal for something, then ask what I think.  If I didn't have the political background that I do, I would not know WHAT to say.  However, I know how to play along to shut him up sooner, and that's what I do.  It's never what I believe, though, and it's such a sad situation.  I can't even be honest with him or he might just tell me to leave.

**TL;DR:  American politics is currently fucked, and it's really freaking me out.  My Dad *loves* Trump and watches Fox News constantly, even when I'm visiting, and gets all up in my bubble with his ideology whilst not knowing that I vehemently disagree with almost everything he says.**

*EDIT:  You people who are insulting me and PMing me for expressing how I feel need to get some hobbies.  If anyone would actually like some in-depth information and a timeline regarding my anxiety, look through my post history.  I didn't suddenly get anxious about this particular topic whilst having no anxiety regarding anything else.  I'm not targeting anyone specific with my initial post, I was just trying to talk to some people that I thought would understand.*

*BUT, if you do feel upset by my post, instead of calling me names or sending me threats, maybe you should recognize the fact that you feel anxious for a similar reason despite our differing political beliefs.  Because it's the same feeling.*

Im scared, im sad, I feel like I let a lot of people down and again, Im sorry. Its time I fix me. Im nervous but ima get through this.

I wont be around to promote much, but the good folks at Republic and my manager Dennis will inform you about upcoming releases. The music videos, album release date etc. The album is still on the way. Promise. I wanted to square away all the business before I got here so I could focus on my recovery.

If all goes well ill be out in time for Complexcon and ill be lookin forward to seeing you all there for high fives and hugs.

Love and light to everyone who has love for me and I am sorry if I let anyone down. I really am sorry. Ill be back, stronger, better. Reborn. I feel like shit, I feel so ashamed. Im sorry.

How I Beat my Anxiety Disorder and Advice on How to do so Yourself,592,False,"So if you‚Äôre reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I‚Äôve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don‚Äôt stop, I‚Äôve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I‚Äôve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I‚Äôve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I‚Äôve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I‚Äôve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I‚Äôve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I‚Äôm here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I‚Äôll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn‚Äôt really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you‚Äôre at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don‚Äôt discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you‚Äôre looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don‚Äôt feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don‚Äôt have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you‚Äôll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you‚Äôll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It‚Äôs going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it‚Äôll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you‚Äôre at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can‚Äôt calm down:

At this stage, you‚Äôre either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I‚Äôve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don‚Äôt try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you‚Äôll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn‚Äôt working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won‚Äôt stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you‚Äôve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you‚Äôll find it can‚Äôt. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you‚Äôre interested, the clinical term for this is ‚Äúarousal reappraisal.‚Äù It‚Äôs not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being ‚Äúengaged.‚Äù This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you‚Äôre at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it‚Äôs an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can‚Äôt sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you‚Äôll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they‚Äôre no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you‚Äôll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you‚Äôre in a constant state of panic, they‚Äôre a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don‚Äôt recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I‚Äôve found it doesn‚Äôt really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you‚Äôre thinking or feeling. It‚Äôs a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don‚Äôt need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you‚Äôre getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It‚Äôs much easier to feel short of breath when you‚Äôre in a position that doesn‚Äôt let you breath easily. If you‚Äôre lying down, lay on your back. If you‚Äôre sitting, sit up straight.

Once you‚Äôve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you‚Äôre at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you‚Äôre not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here‚Äôs what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you‚Äôre going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what‚Äôs going on in your brain and body, the better you‚Äôll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they‚Äôll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you‚Äôre knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who‚Äôs been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you‚Äôre at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It‚Äôs aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It‚Äôs long, so I don‚Äôt think you need to do the first part, but there‚Äôs a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren‚Äôt worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as ‚Äúan incurable disease‚Äù in this book. He‚Äôs not a doctor or therapist and isn‚Äôt really knowledgeable on the subject, so I‚Äôd take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn‚Äôt to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you‚Äôll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you‚Äôre saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn‚Äôt know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who‚Äôs right for you, but this is a person you‚Äôll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they‚Äôll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you‚Äôre taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you‚Äôre down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It‚Äôs said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you‚Äôre anxious, but I‚Äôd like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you‚Äôre anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don‚Äôt dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you‚Äôre not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don‚Äôt need to do sprints whenever you run, but you‚Äôll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you‚Äôre having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it‚Äôs almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you‚Äôre just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won‚Äôt go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably read the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of your diet about a hundred times, but I‚Äôll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn‚Äôt entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I‚Äôll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won‚Äôt bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor‚Äôs discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn‚Äôt to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won‚Äôt change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn‚Äôt change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you‚Äôve been at these things for a while, you‚Äôll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you‚Äôre at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you‚Äôve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn‚Äôt manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you‚Äôre able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You‚Äôve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you‚Äôre still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here‚Äôs what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It‚Äôs easy to flounder or stop, and it‚Äôs okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don‚Äôt beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it‚Äôs part of what makes us human. And it‚Äôs okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you‚Äôve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I‚Äôd find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren‚Äôt meant to be fun**. If you‚Äôve got social anxiety and you‚Äôre challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it‚Äôll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you‚Äôll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it‚Äôll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you‚Äôre anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren‚Äôt I seeing my anxiety improve?‚Äù And the answer in this case is because this person wasn‚Äôt pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn‚Äôt expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It‚Äôs okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you‚Äôre seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you‚Äôre constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can‚Äôt find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. 

**5.** Give it time. I‚Äôve said it before but it‚Äôs important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren‚Äôt the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it‚Äôs also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that‚Äôs kind of vague, I‚Äôll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you‚Äôre using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you‚Äôre someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself ‚Äúthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don‚Äôt know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn‚Äôt see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you‚Äôre not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you‚Äôre the one person out of the fifty who‚Äôs somehow figured out you‚Äôre losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it‚Äôs absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you‚Äôre most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they‚Äôre both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you‚Äôll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You‚Äôre in the home stretch. This is it. You‚Äôre likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you‚Äôve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you‚Äôve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I‚Äôd ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you‚Äôve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it‚Äôs a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you‚Äôre almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you‚Äôll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don‚Äôt last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don‚Äôt really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you‚Äôve clearly demonstrated they work. All that‚Äôs left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you‚Äôll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you‚Äôre still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you‚Äôll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you‚Äôve had anxiety and use what you‚Äôve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you‚Äôre able to ease, the better you‚Äôll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would‚Äôve never been able to do.

There really isn‚Äôt much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you‚Äôve done so far and that there‚Äôs more to come.

Then finally‚Ä¶

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That‚Äôs it. All the voices in your head telling you you‚Äôre not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don‚Äôt really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you‚Äôre energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you‚Äôve never had. It‚Äôs been a few months since you‚Äôve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you‚Äôre not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they‚Äôll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don‚Äôt have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you‚Äôll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it‚Äôs telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it‚Äôs telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that‚Äôs not true. If it‚Äôs telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre losing your mind, remind yourself you‚Äôre not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it‚Äôs just anxiety and can‚Äôt do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You‚Äôve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don‚Äôt fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you‚Äôll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you‚Äôre doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you‚Äôve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it‚Äôll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true. You‚Äôll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you‚Äôve been dreading isn‚Äôt half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You‚Äôll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you‚Äôre at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there‚Äôs anything you want me to expand upon. I‚Äôll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don‚Äôt log into this account all that much, so I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt get to your comment as quickly as you‚Äôd like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources. ",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/7vn317/how_i_beat_my_anxiety_disorder_and_advice_on_how/,"So if you‚Äôre reading this and currently in the midst of an anxiety disorder, let me start by saying I know how you feel. I‚Äôve had panic attacks where the adrenaline rushes just don‚Äôt stop, I‚Äôve been nauseated and unable to eat or drink for days on end, I‚Äôve felt so short of breath it was like drowning above water, had the jitters and the lump in my throat. I‚Äôve also had all of the uncomfortable mental symptoms. I‚Äôve dissociated for almost a full day multiple times, I‚Äôve had racing, intrusive thoughts that lasted weeks and sometimes months at a time. And I‚Äôve felt like I was going crazy. A lot.

But I‚Äôm here to tell you my struggle with my anxiety disorder is over. After almost a year of conscious and concerted effort, all of the worst symptoms of my anxiety are completely gone. Some of the more mild ones still appear from time to time; I‚Äôll get fatigued or dizzy/foggy maybe once every few weeks, but this happens so infrequently (and becomes less frequent with each occurrence) that it doesn‚Äôt really bug me. I was also on medication (an SSRI since day one and a benzo for the first few months) and am in the process of tapering off .

So I wanted to write a post about how to get over each stage of your anxiety, mainly because I know I really would have appreciated this kind of guidance when I first sought help in late April of last year. If you want a summary of things you can do regardless of what stage you‚Äôre at, scroll to the bottom and check the paragraph in bold.

I don‚Äôt discuss responses to specific symptoms here, just a general approach. If you‚Äôre looking for tactics for specific symptoms, check out the list of books I left in the second section. I think the first one does a particularly good job of addressing every symptom, but you can try the third if you don‚Äôt feel it makes enough of a difference.

Before you read, I want to mention something once so I don‚Äôt have to later on. Recovery is going to be like a rollercoaster. Some days you‚Äôll feel like you made incredible progress, and others you‚Äôll have difficulty even doing simple tasks. It‚Äôs going to be a lot of two steps forward, one step back. Sometimes it‚Äôll even be two steps forward, two steps back. But even those times are okay, because they serve as proof that you are capable of improving. Just know that once you start to give effort, things will start gradually getting better.

So here it is. My comprehensive guide to recovering from an anxiety disorder.

If you‚Äôre at a constant 9/10 - 10/10 anxiety and can‚Äôt calm down:

At this stage, you‚Äôre either in the middle of panic attack (which lasts up to 60 minutes) or you have GAD and are constantly anxious. I was diagnosed with GAD and Pure-O but I‚Äôve had maaaaaany panic attacks, so I know this advice will work for both.

**1.** Stop trying to fight your anxiety symptoms. Understand that the best thing you can do for your body right now is just let it run its course. This is the basis of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which is one of the types of therapy currently used to treat anxiety disorders. To do this:

* Don‚Äôt try to stop any symptoms you are experiencing. This is infinitely easier said than done at first, but with practice you‚Äôll be able to pick this up fairly quickly. When I was first having constant adrenaline rushes, I kept trying to consciously stop them. This was actually making things worse. The more you try to fight your symptoms, the more worried you become, which in turn causes your system to release more of the stress-causing hormones, causing your symptoms to become worse. The best thing you can do at this point is wait it out and let your body tire itself out. 

* Questions, doubts, and fear will come up. When they do, remind yourself that this is a totally normal process that your body is going through, and try to rest in the anxiety. It may be difficult, but try to ease into the symptoms. This was initially what helped my adrenaline rushes decrease in severity and frequency.

* If this isn‚Äôt working and you find your symptoms are still persisting and won‚Äôt stop, ask for more. As the DARE Response (discussed later) puts it, run towards your symptoms. If you‚Äôve ever read a book on ACT, this step is likely in there. When you ask your body to make your symptoms worse, you‚Äôll find it can‚Äôt. The symptoms of anxiety are driven by a subconscious worry, and not something you can control. Keep running towards it until your symptoms gradually begin to ease, then move on to step 2. In case you‚Äôre interested, the clinical term for this is ‚Äúarousal reappraisal.‚Äù It‚Äôs not discussed very often, but I found it to be very helpful. 

**2.** Do anything you possibly can to get your mind off of the anxiety. In older forms of anxiety treatment, this kind of thing was referred to as a distraction tactic, but in The DARE Response, Barry McDonagh calls it being ‚Äúengaged.‚Äù This basically means do whatever you can to focus your mind on something other than your anxiety. Regardless of what level of anxiety you‚Äôre at, this is incredibly important. **Your anxiety is most easily fueled when you focus on it, so do whatever you can to move your attention to something else.** Again, MUCH easier said than done, and your mind will fight you at every stage. But it‚Äôs an integral part of recovery. When I first started out, I found short activities the most helpful, like picking up my guitar/cajon and playing a song or two, or doing homework. 

**3.** Give it time. Your system can‚Äôt sustain anxiety levels this high for an extended period of time unless you consciously fuel it. If you are properly easing into your symptoms and engaging yourself in other activities you‚Äôll eventually calm down to the next phase of anxiety recovery.

**4.** If recommended by your physician, a benzo might help. Benzos are basically nervous system relaxants, but they‚Äôre no magic pill. When I took my first dose of valium, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. It took a few days of constant dosing to see any effect. Benzos are fine to use in the very beginning, but I will issue a warning about them: try to use them as sparingly as possible. Benzos are not meant to be used in the long term, and if the first thing you do when feeling anxious is reach for your benzo, you‚Äôll have real difficulty recovering in the later stages. But since at this point, you‚Äôre in a constant state of panic, they‚Äôre a great way to ease you down to the next lowest stage of anxiety, so you can start focusing on the long term.

**5.** Journal. I don‚Äôt recommend this as much beyond this stage, as I‚Äôve found it doesn‚Äôt really help all that much. But in the beginning stages of my experience with GAD, I found journaling to be an indispensable asset to really figure out what I was going through. Just write out whatever you‚Äôre thinking or feeling. It‚Äôs a great what to get out of your head for at least a little bit.

**6.** Get up and do something to release all your pent up adrenaline. Walk around the block, take a stretch break at work. You don‚Äôt need to be doing a full workout at this point, just something to help you use the jitters and adrenaline you‚Äôre getting for something productive.

**7.** This one may seem rather minor, but it helped me a lot in the beginning: fix your posture. It‚Äôs much easier to feel short of breath when you‚Äôre in a position that doesn‚Äôt let you breath easily. If you‚Äôre lying down, lay on your back. If you‚Äôre sitting, sit up straight.

Once you‚Äôve thoroughly calmed down from this point (this took me about three or four weeks), you can move on to the next step.

Constant 6 - 8/10 with occasional panic attacks:

If you‚Äôre at this phase, you are probably still experiencing physical manifestations of your anxiety, like jitters, nausea, jelly legs, shortness of breath, and so on. But you‚Äôre not in constant freakout mode anymore. You can make logical decisions aimed more at long term recovery because rather than being focused on your anxiety 100% of the time, you pay attention to it 80 - 90% of the time. You may be leaving the house occasionally but your symptoms are still bad enough that they keep you at home most of the time. So here‚Äôs what to do at this stage:

**1. Start reading or listening to books on what you‚Äôre going through**. The more you understand the subtleties of what‚Äôs going on in your brain and body, the better you‚Äôll be able fix them. Read up on therapy techniques as they‚Äôll be your quickest route to recovery. In the end, this ended up being the single most helpful thing for my recovery. When you‚Äôre knowledgeable of exactly what is at your disposal, you can try everything and see what works best for you. In fact, I found really helpful ideas in books that none of my therapists had even heard of. Like your anxiety, the list of books that will be the most helpful for you is very personalized, but here are my recommendations (all of these books are available on Audible, which is how I consumed them):

* The DARE Response. Phenomenal book written by someone who‚Äôs been through the worst parts of anxiety and paved his own path to recovery. His techniques are a combination between ACT and a little CBT. I would especially recommend this book if you‚Äôre at the higher end of the anxiety scale.

* Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. This book is considered the gold standard of CBT. It‚Äôs aimed at treating depression, but (as the author notes) it works for anxiety as well. I listened to the whole thing, then picked out the chapters I thought applied to me. It‚Äôs long, so I don‚Äôt think you need to do the first part, but there‚Äôs a lot of valuable information in this book that a lot of other books skim over.

* Rewire Your Anxious Brain. This one is 1/4 CBT, 1/4 lifestyle guidance, and half about the neuroscience behind anxiety. I like this one a lot because it gets into some of the mechanics of why we feel the way we do, and why therapy and lifestyle changes are so impactful.

* The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. This one has been mentioned on this subreddit several times before, and I really like it. It serves as a great reminder of why some things in life just aren‚Äôt worth giving a fuck about. Fair warning: Mark Manson describes OCD as ‚Äúan incurable disease‚Äù in this book. He‚Äôs not a doctor or therapist and isn‚Äôt really knowledgeable on the subject, so I‚Äôd take that section with a grain of salt. But the message he drives home at the end is really good regardless.
Remember, the point of these books isn‚Äôt to give you step by step instructions on how to get better. Rather they are there to give you ideas on how to best help yourself.

**2.** Get into therapy. This is perhaps the second most important things you can do for yourself behind reading. Therapy is the first line of treatment for anxiety, and for good reason. Once you find a therapist who you work well with, you‚Äôll notice you progress much more quickly. Some things to look out for when you screen your therapist:

* Are they nice? Kind of an obvious one but worth going over. Do you feel like they take what you‚Äôre saying seriously? Are their answers usually thoughtful and caring?

* Are they experienced? My first therapist was tremendously nice and caring, but he didn‚Äôt know much about anxiety treatment beyond the very basics, like square breathing. 

* Are they accessible? Or do you have to drive two hours to see them? Are they available for weekly sessions or can you only see them once a month?
It may take a while until you find a therapist who‚Äôs right for you, but this is a person you‚Äôll be meeting with multiple times a month for several months/years. I would advise giving your therapist at least three or four sessions before you consider switching to a new one. 

**3.** Continue with all the acceptance techniques outlined in the previous section. These are things that I remind myself of even now. The more open you are towards your anxiety symptoms, the more quickly they‚Äôll dissipate. In addition, if you can, start easing off your benzo a little bit. If you‚Äôre taking it three times a day, try to move down to two. If you‚Äôre down to two a day, try one.

**4.** Start making some lifestyle changes that are proven to help with anxiety in the long term:

* Cardiovascular exercise. It‚Äôs said that exercise is one of the most positive things to improve mood when you‚Äôre anxious, but I‚Äôd like to look at it from the opposite perspective. When you‚Äôre anxious, your body is filled with excess adrenaline that keeps building up. If you don‚Äôt dump it out somehow, the symptoms will inevitably get worse. So getting up from your desk or your bed is one of the most effective things you can do to help yourself in the long term. If you‚Äôre not super exercise savvy, my suggestion is to get out and walk, jogging occasionally. Walking is great for releasing excess energy, but you can boost the speed at which you let off adrenaline by running. You don‚Äôt need to do sprints whenever you run, but you‚Äôll get the most out of your exercise if you really challenge yourself each time. More on this later.

* Meditation. The reason so many people say this is so good for anxiety is because it helps you better come to terms with your symptoms. It also lets you really hone in on some of the less productive thought processes you‚Äôre having so you can learn to catch and correct them. Keep in mind, the purpose of meditation is not to clear your mind and think of nothing. In fact, it‚Äôs almost the opposite. While meditating, your job is to let your body and brain work as normal and merely try to act as a conscious observer of all your thoughts and feelings. A really popular visualization technique for this is thinking of your thoughts as clouds, and you‚Äôre just watching them pass by. There is plenty of information out there on how to meditate, and it includes helpful techniques like noting, so I won‚Äôt go into it that much here. Make sure that your approach to meditation is similar to your approach to exercise: slowly ease into it by doing it for short periods at first, then working up very gradually to longer periods after every couple sessions. I suggest trying out the meditation app Calm.

* Diet. If you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôve probably read the do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts of your diet about a hundred times, but I‚Äôll reiterate quickly here: no caffeine, no alcohol. Try your best to avoid excessive sweets and fried foods, and those are shown [1] to worsen your mood in the long term. One of the less known changes you can make to your diet is to include more natural sources of magnesium. It is speculated [2] that magnesium plays a part in anxiety regulation, though the research isn‚Äôt entirely there yet. Regardless, try to include dark leafy greens like spinach and whole grains like brown rice into your diet to hit this as a staple. You can also take a magnesium supplement (I‚Äôll defer to the DARE Response for information about it), though again, research is shaky so this alone won‚Äôt bring change. 

* Medication. This one will be completely at you/your doctor‚Äôs discretion. Some people respond well to antidepressants, some don‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt feel like they helped me all that much, but you might. Note, the purpose of antidepressants isn‚Äôt to make you happy or to gradually cure your anxiety. Research shows [3] that antidepressants are useful for supplementing long term change in the brain. This is a REALLY important thing to note because it means that antidepressants won‚Äôt change anything on their own. Only if you give conscious effort will you be able to see positive change. Medication only makes it happen more quickly.

**5.** Give it time. Your nervous system doesn‚Äôt change overnight. It may need a week or two more before you achieve the results you want. So just keep practicing your therapy techniques and doing everything you know works and push through.

Once you‚Äôve been at these things for a while, you‚Äôll notice your anxiety start to decrease to the next phase.

Hovering around 4 - 6:

If you‚Äôre at this stage, congratulations! The first two stages are really hard to break out of, and if you did, it likely took a tremendous amount of effort. So give yourself a pat on the back. Once you‚Äôve reached this stage, your anxiety likely doesn‚Äôt manifest itself physically as much. You may still get nauseated occasionally, but most of the time you‚Äôre able to eat and drink and (hopefully) sleep through the night. You‚Äôve started reclaiming your normal life. You get out of the house relatively frequently and do things like run errands. But you‚Äôre still really anxious whenever you go out. In addition, though your physical symptoms may have eased up, your mental symptoms may still be incredibly difficult to deal with. So here‚Äôs what you should do at this stage:

**1.** Keep staying the course. It‚Äôs easy to flounder or stop, and it‚Äôs okay if you do. But remember to pick up right where you left off. Also, don‚Äôt beat yourself up for making mistakes. Everyone falters from time to time, it‚Äôs part of what makes us human. And it‚Äôs okay if things are taking longer than you expected. Take it from me that if you keep looking for ways you can improve your anxiety and practicing the techniques you know work, things will get better.

**2.** Keep pushing the envelope. Identify areas of your life that you‚Äôve always been anxious about and challenge yourself to use therapy techniques to improve them. I used to beat myself up for being awkward ever since I was a little kid. I‚Äôd find flaws in every interaction I had with others and nitpick every little thing. Once I started working on this, I noticed not only an improvement in these kinds of situations, but also an improvement in my overall anxiety. This is part of how Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy works. You expose yourself to situations that make your anxiety flare up, and use CBT techniques to curb your conscious worry. An important note about this is **these experiences aren‚Äôt meant to be fun**. If you‚Äôve got social anxiety and you‚Äôre challenging yourself by going to meet new people, it‚Äôll likely be an uncomfortable experience the first few times. People around you may be having plenty of fun while you keep worrying and criticizing yourself. But you‚Äôll slowly notice improvement, and with time, it‚Äôll become more and more natural over time.

**3.** Along the same lines, start making your workouts more difficult. Run/bike/swim for longer, lift heavier weights. When you‚Äôre anxious, you tend to stagnate in certain areas of your life, sometimes without realizing it. The only way to get better is to keep pushing the bounds of what you do. I saw a post on this subreddit a while ago along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been lightly jogging for 25 minutes a day for the last month or two, why aren‚Äôt I seeing my anxiety improve?‚Äù And the answer in this case is because this person wasn‚Äôt pushing him/herself. If you continue to do the same things, you shouldn‚Äôt expect to see improvement.

**4.** Start identifying and cutting off some of your crutches/unhealthy habits. For a lot of us (me included), this comes in the form of googling symptoms or constantly asking for help on this subreddit. It‚Äôs okay to cave every once in a while at this stage, but you need to consciously stop yourself from constantly asking for help on the internet. One of the things this does is keep you focused on your anxiety, which is exactly what engaging yourself is meant to prevent. I stopped browsing this subreddit for almost a half year, and my condition got much better as a result. If you‚Äôre seriously concerned about something, visit your doctor/psychiatrist/therapist and ask them, but once they diagnose you, do not second guess it. I spent my entire college career going to different doctors (I think at least 10 or 11 different types, sometimes multiple doctors of each kind). I was convinced there was something wrong with me that no one could find, but the true culprit was anxiety. If you **feel** like you‚Äôre constantly sick or dying, yet doctors can‚Äôt find anything wrong, this is a clue that you have an issue with being a hypochondriac. You can go about fixing this the way you did in all areas of your therapy (I personally used the CBT method outlined in Feeling Good), but the important thing is to recognize that just because your brain is telling you something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs true. 

**5.** Give it time. I‚Äôve said it before but it‚Äôs important to reiterate. Recovering from this stage might take several months, so try your best to be patient. And remember, if things aren‚Äôt the way you want them to be now, they will be soon.

I think it‚Äôs also important to discuss the idea of **cognitive fusion**, which you may have come across in your book reading, as I think understanding it will be really helpful. Google defines cognitive fusion as attaching a thought to an experience, but since that‚Äôs kind of vague, I‚Äôll give my own definition. Cognitive fusion is when you take what your thoughts tell you as fact. In other words, you‚Äôre using your thoughts to draw irrational conclusions about the world around you. One example of this is if you‚Äôre someone who criticizes themselves too much. You might tell yourself ‚Äúthat conversation was so awkward, so that person must think I‚Äôm a loser.‚Äù In this case, whether or not the situation was awkward, you don‚Äôt know what the other person is thinking. I used to think this a lot until I realized people really didn‚Äôt see me that way, and all the worrying I did was for nothing. A healthy level of questioning can do lots to help you overcome your anxiety.

At this stage, I had the most trouble with mental symptoms, namely the feeling of going crazy. I thought the little floaters in my eyes were hallucinations, I always second guessed my own sanity, I thought the weird dreams or intrusive thoughts I was having were a sign of schizophrenia, and anytime I was happy, I thought it was a sign of bipolar disorder. This is another great example of cognitive fusion that took me a while to get over: I thought I was going crazy, so to me that was evidence that I really was. If you think this describes you, it might do you well to get into the habit of questioning your thoughts as well. Is it more logical that your psychiatrist, therapists, family, and friends are correct when they say you‚Äôre not crazy and are just experiencing symptoms of anxiety, or that you‚Äôre the one person out of the fifty who‚Äôs somehow figured out you‚Äôre losing it? This applies to basically every anxious situation you may encounter. Remember: **just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true**.

One of the things that took me a long time to realize was that my constant worry over these things was caused by the fact that I was paying so much attention to them. At this point in recovery, it‚Äôs absolutely **imperative that you keep yourself occupied, especially when you‚Äôre most anxious**. I found that doing things like cooking and cleaning were ways to keep my mind off my anxiety without having to think about it. I suggest doing the same, as they‚Äôre both productive and beneficial in the end. Eventually, your mind will calm down on its own and you‚Äôll find your own solutions to these symptoms. I find that at this point the really important thing really is time. Once I felt like I was going crazy for the hundredth time, I realized that if every time before this one was a false alarm, this one (and all the ones after for that matter) are false alarms too. This stage took about 3 months to recover from, but once I did, I hit the next stage.

Anxiety is 1 - 3 most days, with some days feeling almost completely anxiety free:

You‚Äôre in the home stretch. This is it. You‚Äôre likely already giving yourself credit for all the hard work you‚Äôve done, but you should still take a moment to recognize just how far you‚Äôve come. For me, having a day where I go out and try something new with friends while anxious is something I wouldn't have been able to do even BEFORE my anxiety disorder. Certainly not anything I‚Äôd ever dreamed of while in the thick of it. Seriously, if you‚Äôve hit this point, the light should be at the end of the tunnel. And on the days where it‚Äôs a little harder to deal with, let me reassure you: you‚Äôre almost home free.

Note: your symptoms will still be present at this point. Some of the intrusive thoughts might still come, sometimes you‚Äôll have a bit of dissociation or an occasional almost-panic attack, but you know how to deal with these things. Your moments of panic don‚Äôt last more than a few seconds, and your symptoms don‚Äôt really illicit a response from you. At this stage:

**1.** You know what works best for you. Keep doing it. You have your techniques and you‚Äôve clearly demonstrated they work. All that‚Äôs left is to keep doing them and reap the rewards you know will come. On the worse days when your anxiety peaks at a 3 or 4, remind yourself where you were several months ago and how you‚Äôll never experience anxiety that bad ever again. Then gently engage yourself in something and ride the wave of anxiety until it subsides. 

**2.** Slowly lose your crutches. If you discuss your anxiety with your friends, stop doing so as frequently and eventually stop altogether. If you‚Äôre still occasionally taking benzos, slowly taper off. The more of your independence you get back, the more confident you‚Äôll feel.

**3.** Keep exploring other areas of your life where you‚Äôve had anxiety and use what you‚Äôve learned to stop worrying. For me, this meant things like conquering my fear of heights by going snowboarding, and confronting my discomfort with physical and emotional intimacy by going out of my way to discuss these things. The more of these long-standing anxieties you‚Äôre able to ease, the better you‚Äôll feel overall. Plus you get the added sense of achievement for doing things that past you would‚Äôve never been able to do.

There really isn‚Äôt much left to say at this stage. I found myself being discouraged more frequently at this point just because I knew I was so close to the finish line but not quite there. In case you need any encouragement, remind yourself of how well you‚Äôve done so far and that there‚Äôs more to come.

Then finally‚Ä¶

No anxiety, with the worst days peaking at a 0.5 or 1:

That‚Äôs it. All the voices in your head telling you you‚Äôre not good enough have gone silent. All those symptoms you used to worry so much about don‚Äôt really happen anymore. You might still be a bit fatigued or foggy some days, but most of the time you‚Äôre energetic, present, and can confront new challenges with a sense of confidence you‚Äôve never had. It‚Äôs been a few months since you‚Äôve even given your anxiety a second thought. You know some of your symptoms might come back for a short spell every once in a while, but you‚Äôre not worried about them. You know exactly what to do when that happens, and that they‚Äôll go away just as quickly as they came.

I don‚Äôt have any advice for this point. You know what got you here and have built up the mental fortitude to know you‚Äôll keep on doing it. 

Congratulations. You understand how amazing it is that you got to this point. Remember this feeling.
_

My therapist once gave me a great rule of thumb I think sums things up really well: whatever your anxiety is telling you to do, do the opposite. If it‚Äôs telling you not to get out of bed, do it. If it‚Äôs telling you not to go to a social event, do that. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre going to suffer from some grave illness, remind yourself that‚Äôs not true. If it‚Äôs telling you to google your symptoms or ask for help, don‚Äôt. If it‚Äôs telling you you‚Äôre losing your mind, remind yourself you‚Äôre not. Give it enough time, and eventually things will get better. 

**Summary:**

**Ease into your symptoms. Remember that it‚Äôs just anxiety and can‚Äôt do anything other than make you uncomfortable. You‚Äôve been through this a hundred times before and survived every single time.**

**Don‚Äôt fight it. When you fight your anxiety, it only gets worse. So let your anxiety do whatever it wants and just watch as a detached observer.**

**Keep yourself occupied. The more time you spend thinking about your anxiety, googling your symptoms, posting on this subreddit, writing in your journal, or just stewing in general, the worse off you‚Äôll be. Cook, clean, dance, exercise, paint, draw, do anything you can to forcibly rip your mind off your anxiety.**

**Keep pushing the bounds of what you‚Äôre doing. Expose yourself to more anxiety. Exercise harder. Try things you‚Äôve never tried before. Make your anxiety flare up as much as possible because you know it‚Äôll only benefit you in the end.**

**Regularly question your thoughts. Just because you think something doesn‚Äôt make it true. You‚Äôll find a hundred times out of a hundred the thing you‚Äôve been dreading isn‚Äôt half as horrible as your brain has made it out to be.**

**Give it time. You‚Äôll find once you experience the same anxiety for the same reason for the thousandth time in a row that it becomes a bit easier to stop believing what it tells you.**

Thank you for reading this. I really hope that, no matter where you‚Äôre at in life, you gained something from this. Please let me know what parts of this were the most helpful, or if there‚Äôs anything you want me to expand upon. I‚Äôll try to respond to comments as best I can, but I work full time and don‚Äôt log into this account all that much, so I‚Äôm sorry if I don‚Äôt get to your comment as quickly as you‚Äôd like.

Edit: Sorry if the formatting is a little funky. 

Edit 2: Thank you guys for the overwhelmingly positive response! I've read all of your comments and am super happy ya'll found this helpful. I want to remind all of you who are currently going through bouts of anxiety that you absolutely will make it through and that you'll be a much better person for it. 

Keep in mind: anxiety does not define you. An anxiety disorder is not a permanent condition. Much like any other illness or disorder, you can take gradual steps to recover. It may not come as quickly as you want and you will encounter plenty of pitfalls. But once you start counting your victories, however small, you'll realize what a **huge** difference your efforts can make.

Good luck guys :)

Edit 3: Tossed another David Burns book (author of Feeling Good), **When Panic Attacks**, up in the book list. Thanks u/PM10inPAYPAL4LULZ. Also fixed some formatting issues.

Edit 4: Thanks again for all the support everyone. I'm glad people are still managing to find this post even though it was written almost a half year ago. I tossed a book recommended by u/andrelolzi up on the list in case anyone is looking for more resources. ",7vn317,Anxiety,734

I practised being late this morning. No catastrophes resulted.,591,False,"Like a lot of people here, being late ramps my anxiety up to 11. This morning I woke up a little later than I would have wanted. I've been sick this week and my sleep has been a bit off.

I hate being late but I also hate feeling rushed, so in order to get to my 9:15 am weaving workshop, I wake up every Tuesday morning at 6:00 am. It gives me plenty of time to get up, get showered and dressed, and pack the part of my lunch that wasnt packed the night before--all at a leisurely pace.

But today I woke up at 7:00. I was faced with a choice: rush, or be late. Now, usually when I face that choice, I pick the secret third option and call in absent. But I've missed a lot of workshops lately due to things like appointments, and I knew the longer I was away, the harder it would be to come back, because my brain goblins were already saying things like ""you've missed so many sessions, they're going to kick you out of the program."" They won't but they also expect you to attend, because space in the program is limited, so my goblins have a bit of grey area to work with.

9 Hacks To Get A Handle On Your Anxiety Right Now,591,False,"
Anxiety Hack #1: Get up and move your body!
It‚Äôs pretty hard to give in to feelings of anxiety when you‚Äôre engaged in physical activity and those happy hormones, or endorphins, are getting released. This hack works best if you start moving as soon as you begin to experience those anxious thoughts and the adrenaline creeping in because it‚Äôll prevent the anxiety from escalating. Choose a type of exercise you enjoy or even something childlike, such as bouncing on a trampoline or doing the ‚ÄúCotton-Eyed Joe.‚Äù I dare you to try one of those and not crack a giggle. Also, if possible, take it outside for the extra benefits of sunlight, fresh air, and a dose of vitamin D. 

Anxiety Hack #2: BREATHE.
One of the most effective and simple deep breathing exercises for calming anxiety and overall relaxing is the 4-7-8 breathing technique developed by Dr. Andrew Weil (based off of pranayama yoga.) 
Here‚Äôs how you do it:
Find a quiet and comfortable place to either lie down or sit up straight with good posture.
Rest the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, right behind your front teeth.
Let your lips part and make an obnoxious whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.
Then, with your lips closed, inhale through your nose as you count to 4.
Hold that breath for 7 counts.
Exhale from your mouth for 8 counts. Don‚Äôt forget the annoying ‚Äúwhoooooooshhhhh!‚Äù It‚Äôs key. ;)
Do this at least four times.

Anxiety Hack #3: Repeat affirmations.
Saying affirmations out loud to yourself may seem out there, but can be extremely powerful when it comes to taming anxiety. The following affirmations have worked for me at the peak of an anxiety attack when I‚Äôve felt crippled by that impending feeling of doom and darkness. 
‚ÄúI am okay.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here before. This too shall pass.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am more than my anxiety.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will transform my anxiety into positive, calming energy.‚Äù
‚ÄúI breathe out tension and breathe in serenity.‚Äù
‚ÄúI breathe out fear and breathe in love.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will overcome this like I always do. I am getting stronger and stronger.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am safe within myself. There is nothing to fear.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy body is filled with loving and calming energy.‚Äù

Anxiety Hack #4: Write it out.
Journaling, or just jotting down those thoughts that are running through your mind at the speed of light, in the moment can bring you some peace. If you don‚Äôt have a journal, use the notes section of your phone and write out whatever thoughts you have running through your mind. Whether it‚Äôs a to-do list of things you need done by the end of the week, a poem, or a bunch of swear words, writing it down (or typing it out) is a form of release. Trust me, you will feel some tension lift.

Anxiety Hack #5: Listen to feel good music.
Music has a powerful effect on your mood and energy. The key is to listen to happy, calming music, even if that‚Äôs not the type of music in your Spotify library. Choose music that reflects the way you want to feel and that will soothe your anxious mind. Personally, my go-to for happy, relaxing beats is anything by Kygo, Sam Feldt, or Bonobo.

Anxiety Hack #6: Get in touch with your spiritual side.
Connecting to a higher power is pretty much a guaranteed way of calming down feelings of anxiety. Whether you choose to pray, meditate, chant mantras, or hold crystals, doing something spiritual will help ground you and give you peace of mind. My favorite way to calm my restless mind at night is to take an epsom salt bath, turn on my latest Headspace meditation, close my eyes, and just focus on my breathing. Actually, this combines three anxiety hacks into one 10-minute activity - meditating (getting in touch with my spiritual side), deep breathing (hack #2), and self-care (hack #7). 

Anxiety Hack #7: Show yourself some tender love and self-care.
There‚Äôs nothing better than stopping an anxiety attack in its tracks by doing something pleasurable for your mind and body. When you feel those dreaded, worry-filled thoughts manifest in your body as a rapid heartbeat or sweaty palms, throw your hands up, say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough!‚Äù and go treat your poor body like royalty. Get a massage, give yourself a facial treatment, get a mani-pedi, take a bath, get your hair did, anything that you know will make you feel good, physically. Taking care of yourself and your body is therapeutic. Self-care is a form of self-love and self-love produces positive thoughts and emotions, which crowd out those negative, fearful feelings.

Anxiety Hack #8: Love your anxiety.
Yes, you read that right. One of the ways we tend to make our anxiety worse is by judging it and ourselves as something negative and horrible that needs fixing. If there‚Äôs one thing you take away from reading this article, I hope it‚Äôs this -  every belief or behavior has a positive intention, therefore any negative thoughts or destructive behaviors are not the problem. They are just the best solution you have come up with so far.
What if, instead of looking at your anxiety as something you hate and want to ‚Äúfix‚Äù, you saw it as the only way your mind knows how to cope with whatever it is you are dealing with? What if you looked at your battles with anxiety as victories that make you a stronger person? What if you listened to what your anxiety is trying to tell you and focus on fixing that problem?
The thing about anxiety is, we put so much energy, time, and money into trying to heal the symptoms of anxiety when what we really need to heal is the fear or trauma that triggers this unnerving cascade in the first place. Which brings me to the last hack‚Ä¶

Anxiety Hack #9: Listen to and get acquainted with your body.
If you‚Äôre experiencing symptoms of anxiety and you have no clue why or where they‚Äôre coming from, it‚Äôs time to take a closer look at your lifestyle choices and health. Three of the top anxiety triggers are caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. If you‚Äôre consuming any or all of these, try eliminating them from your diet for a few weeks, preferably a full month. Then, slowly add one in at a time to see how your body responds. Chances are, you won‚Äôt go back and if you do, you‚Äôll find a healthier and more moderate way to integrate it into your lifestyle. 
Health issues, hormonal imbalances, and food allergies can also trigger anxiety. Make sure you know what‚Äôs going on inside your body. Knowledge about your body‚Äôs natural tendencies and providing your body with nourishing, whole foods is groundbreaking when it comes to managing your anxiety. Once you‚Äôre more in touch with your body and its needs, you begin to trust your mind and body and their reactions. You‚Äôll begin to feel energy shifts when you walk into rooms or engage with others. Your intuition becomes clearer and you‚Äôll be able to tell the difference between ‚Äúgood vibes‚Äù and ‚Äúbad vibes‚Äù...and act accordingly.",True,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/c6gtvd/9_hacks_to_get_a_handle_on_your_anxiety_right_now/,"
Anxiety Hack #1: Get up and move your body!
It‚Äôs pretty hard to give in to feelings of anxiety when you‚Äôre engaged in physical activity and those happy hormones, or endorphins, are getting released. This hack works best if you start moving as soon as you begin to experience those anxious thoughts and the adrenaline creeping in because it‚Äôll prevent the anxiety from escalating. Choose a type of exercise you enjoy or even something childlike, such as bouncing on a trampoline or doing the ‚ÄúCotton-Eyed Joe.‚Äù I dare you to try one of those and not crack a giggle. Also, if possible, take it outside for the extra benefits of sunlight, fresh air, and a dose of vitamin D. 

Anxiety Hack #2: BREATHE.
One of the most effective and simple deep breathing exercises for calming anxiety and overall relaxing is the 4-7-8 breathing technique developed by Dr. Andrew Weil (based off of pranayama yoga.) 
Here‚Äôs how you do it:
Find a quiet and comfortable place to either lie down or sit up straight with good posture.
Rest the tip of your tongue on the roof of your mouth, right behind your front teeth.
Let your lips part and make an obnoxious whooshing sound as you exhale through your mouth.
Then, with your lips closed, inhale through your nose as you count to 4.
Hold that breath for 7 counts.
Exhale from your mouth for 8 counts. Don‚Äôt forget the annoying ‚Äúwhoooooooshhhhh!‚Äù It‚Äôs key. ;)
Do this at least four times.

Anxiety Hack #3: Repeat affirmations.
Saying affirmations out loud to yourself may seem out there, but can be extremely powerful when it comes to taming anxiety. The following affirmations have worked for me at the peak of an anxiety attack when I‚Äôve felt crippled by that impending feeling of doom and darkness. 
‚ÄúI am okay.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôve been here before. This too shall pass.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am more than my anxiety.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will transform my anxiety into positive, calming energy.‚Äù
‚ÄúI breathe out tension and breathe in serenity.‚Äù
‚ÄúI breathe out fear and breathe in love.‚Äù
‚ÄúI will overcome this like I always do. I am getting stronger and stronger.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am safe within myself. There is nothing to fear.‚Äù
‚ÄúMy body is filled with loving and calming energy.‚Äù

Anxiety Hack #4: Write it out.
Journaling, or just jotting down those thoughts that are running through your mind at the speed of light, in the moment can bring you some peace. If you don‚Äôt have a journal, use the notes section of your phone and write out whatever thoughts you have running through your mind. Whether it‚Äôs a to-do list of things you need done by the end of the week, a poem, or a bunch of swear words, writing it down (or typing it out) is a form of release. Trust me, you will feel some tension lift.

Anxiety Hack #5: Listen to feel good music.
Music has a powerful effect on your mood and energy. The key is to listen to happy, calming music, even if that‚Äôs not the type of music in your Spotify library. Choose music that reflects the way you want to feel and that will soothe your anxious mind. Personally, my go-to for happy, relaxing beats is anything by Kygo, Sam Feldt, or Bonobo.

Anxiety Hack #6: Get in touch with your spiritual side.
Connecting to a higher power is pretty much a guaranteed way of calming down feelings of anxiety. Whether you choose to pray, meditate, chant mantras, or hold crystals, doing something spiritual will help ground you and give you peace of mind. My favorite way to calm my restless mind at night is to take an epsom salt bath, turn on my latest Headspace meditation, close my eyes, and just focus on my breathing. Actually, this combines three anxiety hacks into one 10-minute activity - meditating (getting in touch with my spiritual side), deep breathing (hack #2), and self-care (hack #7). 

Anxiety Hack #7: Show yourself some tender love and self-care.
There‚Äôs nothing better than stopping an anxiety attack in its tracks by doing something pleasurable for your mind and body. When you feel those dreaded, worry-filled thoughts manifest in your body as a rapid heartbeat or sweaty palms, throw your hands up, say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough!‚Äù and go treat your poor body like royalty. Get a massage, give yourself a facial treatment, get a mani-pedi, take a bath, get your hair did, anything that you know will make you feel good, physically. Taking care of yourself and your body is therapeutic. Self-care is a form of self-love and self-love produces positive thoughts and emotions, which crowd out those negative, fearful feelings.

Anxiety Hack #8: Love your anxiety.
Yes, you read that right. One of the ways we tend to make our anxiety worse is by judging it and ourselves as something negative and horrible that needs fixing. If there‚Äôs one thing you take away from reading this article, I hope it‚Äôs this -  every belief or behavior has a positive intention, therefore any negative thoughts or destructive behaviors are not the problem. They are just the best solution you have come up with so far.
What if, instead of looking at your anxiety as something you hate and want to ‚Äúfix‚Äù, you saw it as the only way your mind knows how to cope with whatever it is you are dealing with? What if you looked at your battles with anxiety as victories that make you a stronger person? What if you listened to what your anxiety is trying to tell you and focus on fixing that problem?
The thing about anxiety is, we put so much energy, time, and money into trying to heal the symptoms of anxiety when what we really need to heal is the fear or trauma that triggers this unnerving cascade in the first place. Which brings me to the last hack‚Ä¶

Anxiety Hack #9: Listen to and get acquainted with your body.
If you‚Äôre experiencing symptoms of anxiety and you have no clue why or where they‚Äôre coming from, it‚Äôs time to take a closer look at your lifestyle choices and health. Three of the top anxiety triggers are caffeine, sugar, and alcohol. If you‚Äôre consuming any or all of these, try eliminating them from your diet for a few weeks, preferably a full month. Then, slowly add one in at a time to see how your body responds. Chances are, you won‚Äôt go back and if you do, you‚Äôll find a healthier and more moderate way to integrate it into your lifestyle. 
Health issues, hormonal imbalances, and food allergies can also trigger anxiety. Make sure you know what‚Äôs going on inside your body. Knowledge about your body‚Äôs natural tendencies and providing your body with nourishing, whole foods is groundbreaking when it comes to managing your anxiety.

"Finally after 8 years of severe anxiety and daily panic attacks I have finally got to the point where I no longer take daily medication, and am basically ‚Äòcured‚Äô.",583,False,"I (26 m) am by no means saying that I still don‚Äôt feel anxious now and then but I have definitely regained control of my life. I am now living the life that I want to live. No longer is anxiety holding me back from doing anything in life I want to.

I am going to try my best to list of a few key points that helped me get to where I am today I no for a fact that I am going to miss out a lot of information just for the fact that it has took a shit ton of little things to get me to where I am.

Taking time to heal: 1 year ago I made the hard decision to take a break from my toxic job to focus on my own health, this was a super hard decision to make but it enabled me to take the time I need to push myself out  of my comfort zone and focus on myself. 

Consistently exercising and eating better: I had no self confidence and was always exhausted so I used to eat junk food most nights just because I felt like shit and the food made me feel worse,  now I eat much cleaner, no caffeine alcohol or sugary drinks stopped smoking especially cannabis, I still treat myself of a weekend to what ever I want but for the most part I plan my meals in advance and make sure I eat them throughout the week. And the benefits of exercise are well documented but could not be underestimated.

Sleep: this was harder than you might think for me and I massively underestimated its value, I have never been a good sleeper usually getting anywhere from 2/5 hours sleep a night was not uncommon, but after a lot of self experimenting what works best for me I have finally got it under control I am now getting between 7/8 hours a night and the difference is chalk and cheese, when you wake up refreshed from a nights sleep there is no better feeling. 

Took a break from ‚ÄòSoical Media‚Äô: I deleted all social media accounts (except Reddit) and to be honest I have not got them back and I don‚Äôt think I will, people portray an image of themselves to the world that they want them to see not their real selves, and it can make you compare yourself to other people which in my opinion is not healthy, focus on yourself. 

Perseverance: not everything you try is going to succeed, over these 8 years I have tried and failed more timed than I could ever count, but I always try again the next day, small victories are the key, I would push myself every day to do something I was uncomfortable doing, some days I would fail but I would try again until I could complete what I had set out to do then more. 

Take experience and tips and tricks from people who have been there before: there is an old saying I can not remember where I heard it but it goes ‚Äò No man is your friend, No man is your enemy, Every man is your teacher‚Äô, and basically my interpretation of it is you can learn from any and everyone, and that is what I did I did my own research and reached out to anyone with knowledge about anxiety and panic attack‚Äôs and see what they knew about it that I didn‚Äôt.

I am not writing this to gloat I am writing this so that if even 1 person out there who thinks there is no way out or that life can never go back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô I am living proof that there is, better days are ahead.

I sometimes feel like I'm just going through the motions, waiting to die.  Anticipating it.

What am I feeling?  What can help me feel content with my life and invested in what I'm doing?

Anyone with any experience like this?

I am now on Lexapro and Concerta and feel much better.",bdwlsf,Anxiety,767

I DROVE TODAY - big win!!,566,False,"I just wanted to share with someone my big victory of the day (month and even year). It's been 5 years since I drove a car, because I was terrified of doing it. (Btw, I have generalized anxiety disorder so it was feeding my fear) I have done and passed my driver's license 5 years ago but after that, didn't drive since then. Today, I was tired of not being able to be independent because I can't make myself drive. I told my SO that I wanted to drive in a really quiet neighborhood near our home. He drove there and after I took the driver's place. I was so scared. I thought i was going to crash or make an accident. I did it anyway. My SO was patient and gave me tips. I parked. He then asked me if I was up to the task of drive back home. To do so I had to go on a main road and a boulevard with a bunch of cars, poeple and construction. I hesitated but said ""fuck it"" and did it. I did it guys. I was scared and nervous all the way home. But I DID IT. I'm proud of myself and I'm even a little excited (and scared) to do it again. 

Best luck for everyone out there.

***EDIT***

Wow! I wanted to thank you all for the amazing support I've been receiving on this post. You're all REALLY sweet to have taken the time to write replies filled with hope, joy and encouragement. If anyone is curious, I drove again today because I didn't want to take the chance of letting anxiety get the best of me again if I would've waited to go back. I was less nervous and did even more different maneuvers (not the freeway though. Not  YET). 

For the people wondering what I did do make myself drive again. I know it will sound really simple but after 5 years of putting off, I had this impulse of juste doing it. Not because I wanted it but because I was tired of not being able to go where I wanted to go or applying to jobs I wanted because I couldn't drive. I had this impulse and knew that if I let myself think to much I would have hesitated. I would have convinced myself of not going. I didn't think. I just said to my SO, OK! WE ARE GOING! Haha. He was a little confused but proud. 

To ease my anxiety, I wanted to start small with some tasks I was less anxious about (driving in a calm neighborhood). That made me feel a little less anxious and even create a positive feeling that I could associate with driving. Because I started small, I was able to perceive a little bit of competence. 

Also, I was anxious of going back driving again. But again, on an impulse that I listened, I went driving again today. A little bit like exposure therapy (as a lot of you in the comments said : practice reduce anxiety!)

I really hope for all of you who struggle (as I am still) to be compassionate towards yourself.

"Found Elsewhere - ""How to Decode a Person With an Anxiety Disorder""",557,False,"(Their title, not mine. :P) 


things we are trying to do all the time:

* be safe

things we can‚Äôt help but do all the time:

* second-guess ourselves
* behave impulsively and reactively
* take everything personally
* worry
* have difficulty accepting compliments
* have difficulty reciprocating friendly gestures
* worry
* have difficulty finding the courage to respond
* have difficulty not being suspicious of others‚Äô intentions
* worry
* make a huge deal out of the smallest thing
* think we're bothering you

things you should keep in mind:

* we‚Äôre scared of everything
* pretty much all of the time
* it‚Äôs an actual disorder
* it manifests as impulsive behavior
* you can‚Äôt fix us with words
* telling us ‚Äúworrying is silly‚Äù won‚Äôt make us stop worrying
* it‚Äôll only make us feel silly
* and then we‚Äôll worry even more
* ‚Äúoh god, am i worrying too much? what if they call me silly again?‚Äù
* like that
* also, we wear a lot of armor
* cold, heavy, affection-proof armor with spikes
* we constructed this armor as children
* we‚Äôre fairly certain you will never be able to pry it apart
* but there is a nice person under there, we promise

things you can do for a friend with an anxiety disorder:

* stick around
* ask them if they‚Äôre comfortable in a place or situation
* be willing to change the place or situation if not
* activities that help them take their mind off of things are good!
* talk to them even when they might not talk back
(they‚Äôre probably too afraid to say the wrong thing)
* try not to take their reactions (or lack thereof) personally
(the way they expresses themself is distorted and bent because of their constant fear)
(and they know this)
* give them time to respond to you
* they will obsess over how they are being interpreted
* they will anticipate being judged
* it took me four hours just to type this much
* even though i sound casual
* that‚Äôs because i have an anxiety disorder

things you shouldn‚Äôt do:

* tell us not to worry
* tell us we‚Äôll be fine
* mistake praise for comfort
* ask us if we are ‚Äúgetting help‚Äù
* force us to be social
* force us to do things that trigger us
* ‚Äúface your fears‚Äù doesn‚Äôt always work
* because‚Äîremember‚Äîscared of everything
* in fact, it would be more accurate to say we are scared of the fear itself

emergency action procedure for panic attacks:

* be calm
* be patient
* don‚Äôt be condescending
* remind us that we‚Äôre not ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù
* sit with us
* ask us to tighten and relax our muscles one by one
* remind us that we are breathing
* engage us in a discussion (if we can talk, then we can breathe)
* if we are having trouble breathing, try getting us to exhale slowly
* (it will be harder for us to exhale than inhale)
* (sometimes all it takes is our body to realize it can push the air back out)
* or breathe through our nose
* or have us put our hands on our stomach to feel each breath
* or have us put a hand on your chest and breath with you
* ask us what needs to change in our environment in order for us to feel safe
* help us change it

Something you should know about her is that she LOVES kneading, but if you pet her while she‚Äôs doing it she‚Äôll stop and probably move away.

I woke up in the middle of the night 
 and started having a panic attack. Almost immediately as I begin doing breathing exercises (that somehow weren‚Äôt working this time), she jumps onto the bed and sits right next to me, a few inches from touching me. She starts kneading my blanket and meowing at me, then she walks back and forth and around me, making sure she‚Äôs rubbing against me the entire time. The whole time she‚Äôs purring and occasionally meowing at me. I start petting her and talking to her, I start calming down because she‚Äôs now keeping me grounded in reality by rubbing on me like that and letting me pet her. She goes back to my side and continues to knead on my blanket while I pet her.

She doesn‚Äôt move away when I keep petting her, even though she‚Äôs kneading. She‚Äôs purring louder than I usually hear her purr, but not meowing. Until I start getting panicked again, even though I‚Äôm petting her. She meows like she‚Äôs bringing me back to reality. We do this for a while longer, then I lay back down in bed and continue doing breathing exercises, hoping to get back to sleep.

She comes up and lays right next to my pillow (not a typical spot for her as she doesn‚Äôt appreciate being brushed against even on accident if she didn‚Äôt want pet), curls up, and gets in a position to sleep there with me. I gently put my arm so it‚Äôs touching her back (she‚Äôs really soft and it‚Äôs comforting), she glances at me before putting her head back down to sleep.

It might be silly and sort of tiny, but it really amazes me how quickly she came to my rescue. Granted, she‚Äôs gotten me through several attacks and it wouldn‚Äôt be hard for her to recognize the difference. This attack was more recent, but as I laid there touching her back I just thought about how sweet it is she at least seems to know when I‚Äôm having an attack and how to handle it as best she can.

My therapist had me try Brainspotting on Friday. Holy shit.,550,False,"I've had anxiety ever since I can remember. The past couple years it's gotten to a point where it was getting so bad that I was developing depression, ruining relationships with friends and family, not leaving my apartment, etc. It was causing a lot of strain on my relationship as well. So after years of saying I'd go see someone.. I finally started seeing someone about a month ago.

Last week she wanted to do a Brainspotting session with me to see what kinds of mid-brain emotions and feelings we could uncover and release. And see how my anxiety manifests, and where, as we learn to identify my thoughts and find potential triggers.

It was intense. I remember when she first explained it to me, I was skeptical. I didn't understand how that could possibly do me any good or even get a reaction. But it did.

We did that for my entire session. I thought about memories I had long forgotten about. Felt my arms get painfully hot, then go numb. My temple throbbed where I get migraines. I cried - a lot. I found it hard to swallow and breathe.

And then with I'd say about 10 minutes left, I felt relief. Not just from those things, but actual mental relief. I felt it leave through my fingertips. I smiled. I still was having thoughts of these people and events, but then went from being negative and hopeless to appreciative and grateful. 

My anxiety over the weekend was basically non-existant. I actaully made an effort to see friends. I felt energy. I felt like a literal weight was lifted off of my shoulders.

I'm not sure anyone else has done this yet, or what their experience has been with it. But I'm interested to hear if you have. And I know it's a fairly new practice, but it's one I'm excited to explore further to see what else can be uncovered and hopefully let go of.

Does anybody else avoid speaking to friends because you worry that they might not reply because they secretly hate you?,551,False,"I'm so frustrated with myself. I know I'm being irrational but I can't help the way I feel.

In a few days my university classes are going to start again and I was unsure about a few things regarding the timetable. Anyway, the obvious solution would lie in asking people who take the same classes, right?

I had to force myself to text into a group chat with people that I'm friendly and never had a problem with. They're all nice and helpful. But since there were no classes, I didn't see them for a while.

 So when I attempted to text, I kept asking myself, 'what if they hate you, what if they only pretended to like you and they're annoyed by your questions, what if they don't reply and you're being too needy' etc.

Logically, I know that these worries make no sense because these people have never done anything to indicate that they might feel this way about me. So, like usually, I bullied (motivated?) myself  into texting anyway. 

When they didn't text back immidiately (which, hello, is totally understandable because they're not available 24/7) I kept working myself up.

I'm so done with myself because, in my head, I know these worries are senseless and that I'm being ridiculous, but I still can't help myself.

I gathered up the courage with aid from an ‚ÄòAskReddit‚Äô post by a female I read years ago.

I used the former example and it worked! She said yes immediately and said that I was speaking her language and that she couldn‚Äôt wait! She gave me her number shortly after.

Before meds, I was always worried I would fail a test but get an A, I would be the jealous boyfriend that saw every guy as a threat and I would obsessively think about what someone said for 3 days straight. My therapist even said some of the things I said we're ridiculous!

I feel forever changed. My relationship has never felt more stable, and we are about to make a year. Managing study time has never been easier. Before it was either anxiety not letting me study, or my ADD. Now, I just worry about ADD :P

I am so happy. Sometimes I feel like crying because of how much more stable I am. I feel *normal.* I still need to work on the shame about taking medication, but quite frankly, after being in therapy for at least 4 years straight, attempts to improve myself, nothing has worked, but Lexapro has.

The 5 by 5 rule helps me get out of my head,518,False,"I read somewhere this rule, and it might seem cliche or whatever but the more I try and remind myself, the easier it helps me cope when I can't stop worrying about that thing I did/said/should've done and can't let it go:

5 by 5: If it's not going to matter in 5 years, don't spend more than 5 minutes thinking about it.

Edit- More context: It's saying for example; I feel really anxious after my boss mentioned I did something small wrong, and even though I know it won't affect my career and my boss is friendly I'm full of anxiety that I'm an idiot.

I then think, is this tiny mistake that I made today, going to have any bearing on my life in five years time? No, so I should just stop thinking about it and move on.

Even if it doesn't take effect immediately, it's repetition of identifying your thoughts that does the trick.

I've had anxiety for over a decade now, and there are definitely situations the rule doesn't work, as plenty of people keep pointing out in the comments. I get that, and I don't think any single technique will apply to every scenario when it comes to anxiety, but you want to utilize as many techniques as possible, right?

I'm just saying, from my own experience, rationalising the actual impact (or lack of) that tiny situations I fret over will actually have in the future, works. 
Think small and start small. You might have anxious thoughts more than you realise, but you need to take note when it happens, and how big a deal the situation really is.

IF you know at the time it's no biggie, I remind myself, ""I know this won't affect me in five years. It's just a little speed bump, but it's not worth investing time and emotion in to"". I have told myself this repeatedly a few times now, and I relax pretty quickly after. It's a habit you need to form. I fully understand how people can interpret this to be like saying ""Well to tell myself to stop thinking something is like saying, just stop worrying and just be happy"". But this is something you are actually being mindful about, recognising that your thoughts come from anxiety and not necessarily a rational place, and making the conscious effort to put a stop to it. Of course it's not always going to be possible, but just keep at it and you'll find it gets easier.

2nd edit: I think most valid reason for thinking this rule is stupid, is because maybe you're thinking off applying it in situations that ARE important and anxiety inducing.

You're anxious about the fact that you have ten dollars in your bank account? Guess what? That's a very valid concern and genuine stressor for any human. This rule will not apply, and no sorry I don't have some other solution for this because a) I'm not a psychologist and b) I'm still trying to fix my own problems, I'm just here to share a rule that may or may not apply in some way in your life.

You're anxious because someone mentioned that you have a weird laugh? Then apply this rule. Sometimes I go one slightly morbid step further and think, on my deathbed, is this going to be something that I wish I had done differently?
So I'm dying, do I think, damn I wish my laugh wasn't so hideous? If I could have just changed that ONE thing, it would be my laugh?

What the heck, right? I was legitimately scared. It wasn‚Äôt a panic attack though, just pure paranoia and an awful stress stomach ache. 

I work in customer service where some customers make me shake with fear and I just can‚Äôt do it today. Honestly I just felt the need to write this post as some kind of proof to myself that it‚Äôs ok for me to not go to work. 


Maybe this post was weird. Just venting, really. 

I wish you all calming day today!

"I started exercising because my anxiety got better, not the other way around",511,False,"There's this widespread belief that if you exercise and improve your physical health, your anxiety will greatly improve. It was entirely the reverse for me.

I switched to a new treatment (CBD) and my anxiety quickly began to improve. Obsessive thoughts stopped and I've continued overcoming one fear after another. My physical wellbeing also improved, and I naturally wanted to exercise more. I wanted to be more active.

I started going to the gym multiple times a week. I'm lifting weights and doing cardio. I'm feeling healthier than ever before in my life.

Exercise helps me feel better, but I wouldn't have been able to have such a good exercise routine without a healthier body and mind thanks to the new treatment. When I'd try exercising before, I felt horrible. No matter how slowly I took it, having to deal with anxiety and my health was too much.

I'm just sharing this because we sometimes forget that anxiety and physical health are interconnected. Sometimes really bad anxiety and mental illness can make exercise and other positive habits difficult or near impossible to achieve.

Thank you all for your support this morning. I quit my job and my boss who is normally evil was very understanding and actually acted like she sincerely cared about me getting better.

"My anxiety decreased significantly when I cut out caffeine, alcohol, weed, sugar, dairy, and gluten.",507,False,"From most impactful to least impactful:
-alcohol
-caffeine 
-sugar
-weed
-dairy
-gluten

The biggest improvement I had in my anxiety was to cut out those first 3. I notice that when I slip and start to eat unhealthy, I start waking up with daily anxiety. I have panic attacks. I can't get anything done. 

Even dairy and gluten impact your gut biome which research shows is tied to your mood. Some people are less sensitive to it, but it's worth trying. 

I know it's super challenging. When you are feeling intense anxiety, you want to feel better by eating comfort foods. It's a vicious cycle. But it's worth a try! So make a point to go to the market and buy some decaf coffee or tea, and some fruit to replace the sweets, and some delightful beverages like kombucha instead of alcohol. These changes have seriously helped me.

Then it was sugar. I found fruit I liked and made a point to buy lots of it. I still have chocolate and other desserts now and then. Moderation. Then it was weed. I stopped smoking weekdays. Then I stopped for 2 months to completely clear out. Now I smoke rarely. Sometimes my CBD pen helps with panic attacks. Dairy was easy, I replaced it with almond milk. I still eat it sometimes if it's hard to avoid, but notice it makes me feel bloated which makes me feel low energy and depressed. Gluten makes me constipated so again, when my body feels bad, I feel bad. But with all of this, I'm very relaxed and cheat.

**NO.**


**NO NO NO.**


**NOT EVEN CLOSE.**


I had no idea what panic was until panic came to me a decade ago. 


Twenty-four years old of strapping athletic just-graduated pilot; cocky and overconfident to the extreme, bitch to nobody and obnoxious master of the known universe. I'm sitting in a pleasant country restaurant with my family and six friends, chowing down my rib-eye steak with a fine red wine and guffawing loudly as I regale the table with stories and bask in my own assured invincibility in the pantheon of men. 


Then a strange little sensation, imperceptible at first. 


Maybe I caught some steak in my throat? No, that's not it. Hmmm, my chest feels kinda strange like a... woah why am I so sweaty? I've stopped talking because my throat has clamped shut like a vice. The oxygen flow has turned to treacle and my throat insists its never known how to swallow. Why is everyone looking at me? Fuck this room is TINY. SO CROWDED. Something is wrong. Something is very wrong. My heart is pounding. My lungs can't function. Vision narrows and greys. The walls spin as the lump in your throat becomes a tumor that envelopes your entire existence. 


Then there is this overpowering feeling; a welling-up of all-encompassing fear. It's like an ocean surge. A rumbling from the depths of your soul that comes from the pit of your stomach at the edge of consciousness, rushing up your throat and into your brain like an unstoppable juggernaut on a collision course with your own demise. It's that crescendo of violins from the most terrifying horror movies just before the monster erupts from the dark, and it's coming for me. My whole temporal experience of the world has turned inwards and I'm pinned helpless to the moment. Inside my head a deafening megaphone overpowers every other thought - *Something dark, evil and truly awful is about to happen to you and you're powerless to stop it.*


Am I dying? Yes, that must be it. I'm dying. Fuck. I'M ACTUALLY ABOUT TO DIE. RIGHT NOW IN THIS ROOM. This is what a heart attack feels like. Your mind swims in a freezing, clammy, boiling torrent of fractured thoughts and confusing sensations as your body assumes the twitching convulsive outline of a fish caught on a hook. Vision loses focus, eyes dart in all directions. 


MY HEART! BOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOMBOOM it goes, with the ruthless life-extinguishing violence of a machine-gun. Nothing seems real, seconds stretch to years. Familiar things distort into terrifying non-shapes as you try to grasp on to the slush that has suddenly replaced reality. Everything is wrong. So wrong. My universe is about to collapse. The only sensation: IMPENDING DOOM. I must escape! If only I can get out of this room in the next three nanoseconds maybe I can survive. 


I stumble to something resembling an upright position and announce garbled words in incoherent gibberish to the table before racing for the door in a shambling, hyperventilating mess. I'm dying. This is it. Any moment now. Will there be pain? I'll never see my family or loved ones again. I never even got to say goodbye. This is the end. Everything lurches and races as the world implodes around you. I sit down and hyperventilate, furiously trying to catch a breath that is never satisfied, obsessively clutching the maniac pulse in my wrist. That's no good. Stand up again. Even worse. Go outside. No, I'll just die out there. Back inside to curl up in a corner. Logic has been obliterated. I am no longer rational. All that I'm aware of is the guaranteed knowledge that I am about to pass irrevocably past the line of my sudden cardiac death. Nothing exists except my crumbling body in a thick swamp of immobilising terror. 


I'm face-down on the floor in the corner of the restaurant, panting for breath, hoping that every gasp of air I can squeeze into my lungs isn't my last and that my heart won't instantly rupture and explode in agony. This lasts an eternity. What is happening to me?
 

There is noise. A commotion. People. Hands on my shoulders. ""ARE YOU OKAY?"" ""HEY, LOOK AT ME!"" Am I okay? No I'm fucking dying you fucking idiot. Do something! Help me! *HELP ME!*



Fifteen minutes of absolute raw-faced terror pass, adrenaline and fear pouring from every sweaty inch of your soaked body. The interminable minutes seem like years. 


Slowly something comes together. The floor is the floor again. It's wooden. Brown. Shiny. I can touch it. That's okay. Hold on to it. The walls are here. I'm wearing blue jeans. My parents are hunched down next to me talking soothing words. 


IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. JUST BREATHE. YOU'RE HAVING A PANIC ATTACK. DON'T WORRY. 


Like a murky runway appearing from the fog, lights of reality slowly begin to emerge. Breathing shallows. My heart starts to slow as the aura of doom subsides into a dull roar like a distant waterfall. 


Dinner is abruptly abandoned and I'm driven home slackjawed, a prisoner to my own reeling mind of neural traffic jams. What the fuck just happened to me? 


Before I know it, I'm on the couch at home with my shirt unbuttoned. An on-call doctor arrives and I try to articulate the symptoms of my almost-death. He attaches bulbous rubber suckers to my chest to perform an ECG, EEG and other tests. Everything is normal. Ask some questions, check the history. Nothing out of the ordinary, all systems nominal. 


""He'll be fine"" the doctor laughs, putting away the machines and tape prints.  ""Classic panic attack. Rest up and drink some tea.""


And that was the day I realized that anxiety and panic attacks aren't the pitiful little hand-flailing bad hair days that I'd condescendingly imagined. 



It's not the momentary nervousness of losing your phone or being late for an appointment. It's not just some trivial moment of stressful overreacting, and it certainly doesn't just happen to weak-willed schoolgirls and pussies. That's not true panic.  


True panic is the instantaneous, all-encompassing explosive jolt of terrifying **certainty** that without a doubt, **you are about to die** - right here and right now as your heart explodes - and submerge suffocatingly into a crushing blackness you never knew existed. 


Anxiety burst into my life without warning during a peaceful family dinner while I was at the prime of my life, so confident in my mastery over the world that I never imagined a crippling betrayal would come from inside my own body.  It can come to anyone at any time. 


I don't laugh about that any more.

There is noise. A commotion. People. Hands on my shoulders. ""ARE YOU OKAY?"" ""HEY, LOOK AT ME!"" Am I okay? No I'm fucking dying you fucking idiot. Do something! Help me! *HELP ME!*



Fifteen minutes of absolute raw-faced terror pass, adrenaline and fear pouring from every sweaty inch of your soaked body. The interminable minutes seem like years. 


Slowly something comes together. The floor is the floor again. It's wooden. Brown. Shiny. I can touch it. That's okay. Hold on to it. The walls are here. I'm wearing blue jeans. My parents are hunched down next to me talking soothing words. 


IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY. JUST BREATHE. YOU'RE HAVING A PANIC ATTACK. DON'T WORRY. 


Like a murky runway appearing from the fog, lights of reality slowly begin to emerge. Breathing shallows. My heart starts to slow as the aura of doom subsides into a dull roar like a distant waterfall. 


Dinner is abruptly abandoned and I'm driven home slackjawed, a prisoner to my own reeling mind of neural traffic jams. What the fuck just happened to me? 


Before I know it, I'm on the couch at home with my shirt unbuttoned. An on-call doctor arrives and I try to articulate the symptoms of my almost-death. He attaches bulbous rubber suckers to my chest to perform an ECG, EEG and other tests. Everything is normal. Ask some questions, check the history. Nothing out of the ordinary, all systems nominal. 


""He'll be fine"" the doctor laughs, putting away the machines and tape prints.  ""Classic panic attack. Rest up and drink some tea.""


And that was the day I realized that anxiety and panic attacks aren't the pitiful little hand-flailing bad hair days that I'd condescendingly imagined. 



It's not the momentary nervousness of losing your phone or being late for an appointment. It's not just some trivial moment of stressful overreacting, and it certainly doesn't just happen to weak-willed schoolgirls and pussies. That's not true panic.  


True panic is the instantaneous, all-encompassing explosive jolt of terrifying **certainty** that without a doubt, **you are about to die** - right here and right now as your heart explodes - and submerge suffocatingly into a crushing blackness you never knew existed. 


Anxiety burst into my life without warning during a peaceful family dinner while I was at the prime of my life, so confident in my mastery over the world that I never imagined a crippling betrayal would come from inside my own body.  It can come to anyone at any time.

Hello everyone! Didn't expect it would have so many upvotes and comments- thank you my fellow Redditors!

**I want to share the story and maybe point out some of the useful tips on how to handle/ help with a panic attack, things that I learned from my cognitive-behavioral therapies and meditation:**

The background of the story: My friend was having a random panic attack for no apparent reason ^(Sometimes) ^(it) ^(happens) ^(to) ^(the) ^(best) ^(of) ^(us:),) she was crying and shaking, couldn't breathe properly, while the other friend who was with her didn't know what to do at all, not to blame them though.

First, you could start by giving them a hug (^(Obviously) ^(only) ^(if) ^(you) ^(know) ^(them) ^(personally,) ^(don't) ^(want) ^(to) ^(make) ^(people) ^(feel) ^(uncomfortable),) take them to a quiet room or indoor space (^(if) ^(you) ^(are) ^(outside,) ^(noises) ^(on) ^(the) ^(street) ^(may) ^(increase) ^(anxiety) ^(level).) In my case, we were indoor already. I then told her that she was in a safe place and I wasn't leaving until she feels better. You could also ask them what is going on/ how are you feeling? She then said to me *""I can't breath""*. So I held her hands and ask her to do some breathing exercises with me. **Start by taking a nice and deep breath, breath in from your nose for 4 seconds, then hold for 1, and exhale from your mouth for 4 seconds, and repeat.** You could either breath in and out with them, or you could count the numbers for them as a guide.

You will be surprised how much this technique would help when a panic attack occurs! While she was doing the breathing exercise, I was still holding her hands and telling her *""You are in control, you are safe, we are all here with you. Panic attacks are uncomfortable, but it's not dangerous""* etc. She was much much calmer after the breathing exercise, at this point, what I did was to talk to her to create some ""distractions"" from her and her anxiety, I find this very helpful personally when I am anxious. **Basically, you are turning your attention outward, and not to focus on yourself or the inner feeling/ physical sensations.** You could ask them simple questions like *""What did you do today?"" ""Where did you go for dinner?""* or even make some jokes along the way. Some people mentioned this technique too in the comments from the last post:

&#x200B;

* u/rogertaylorkillme: ^(What helps me is to ground myself. I try to focus on my surroundings. Things I can see, touch, hear, smell. There‚Äôs a certain way people do it but generally these things can help you realize you‚Äôre okay, life is going on.)
* u/Square-cactus: ^(Yes, this! Something similar is to do the ‚Äò5‚Äô trick. So find 5 things you hear, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you smell, 2 things you can see and 1 thing you can taste (or some combination of this)
* u/BiniTheMighty: ^(This helps for me to. Or find 5 red things, 4 blue, 3 green, 2 yellow, 1 purple. Or counting. Can be anything, like counting squars on my cup or number of red things on a shelf, or whatever. It helps to ground, regain focus on the real world.)

&#x200B;

Lastly, I want to share a podcast called [""The Anxiety Coaches Podcast""](https://podcasts.apple.com/ie/podcast/the-anxiety-coaches-podcast/id908153168) it has helped me so much! Please check them out if you are interested in learning more about anxiety and how to make peace with it;

I have this one downloaded on my Spotify, just in case anything comes up you know.

[""Meditation for Anxiety""](https://www.headspace.com/meditation/anxiety) Again, please do meditations... I know, I know, enough with meditations, but they really helped me when I was struggling to get myself out of the house!

I quit my job,473,False,"The job itself was fine, but the environment and my boss were not. After a horrible night of being disrespected and talked down to, I decided enough was enough.

Today i helped a student having a panic attack in a way he'd never been helped before - with empathy.,473,False,"I am a High School English Teacher. I am also Bipolar, and have lived with anxiety and depression my entire life. It took me nearly 27 years of denial, bottling it in, periods of extreme highs and lows, and constant nagging anxiety before my now wife convinced me to seek medical help - I'm doing much better now thanks to finding the right therapist and psychiatrist :). But enough about me!

Today I was heading down to the copy room to print up some tests for my next class, and I saw an overweight kid (I was a chunky kid in school as well) sitting against the wall. He was shaking and crying, clearly having a panic attack. There were other teachers, and someone from security around him. My coworkers (doing what they thought was right) were asking him over and over ""What's wrong"", ""What happened?"", ""Do you need to talk to someone?"", ""Why are you stressed?"". Every time he would just repeat the same words ""I'm just stressed out"", spiraling worse and worse as he was bombarded.

I came over to check on him, and after seeing what was happening I asked if he could come to my room to decompress for a second, i was on planning after all. They agreed, and we walked over to my classroom. I told him that I have generalized anxiety disorder, and that I've done exactly what he did. Many a time I've let it all overwhelm me and I couldn't tell the people around me any one reason ""why"", when it was just a little bit of everything. I told him that he didn't need to explain, that I knew and understood, and my room was a safe space for him.

He sat there for about 20 minutes, he cried a little more. Composed himself and then told me his name was Eddie. I told Eddie that if he ever needs a safe place that I'll be there for him, and I walked him back to his class, and then ran to make copies of my test.

I hope the rest of his day goes well, and I hope that i've made a good impact on him. Even now I worry that he might be anxious still, but I have faith that he will find the way just like I did.

I hate it when people glorify anxiety,466,False,"I see these posts every week about how girls who are anxious are ""the best wives"", how some idiots claim loud and proud they are anxious and that it made then stronger, how some of my family members laugh at others' suffering by saying anxiety is merely a part of life and they eventually snapped out of it. 

I hate it.

It makes me feel like trash for struggling. Makes me feel ashamed for reaching out. Some people I told about my anxiety issues got excited saying that made me super good at organizing things and I always seemed to know where I was going because of this, but the only reason really is that I can never make a move, even a simple social outing, if I don't know who's there, where it is, when is it over, how do I get back, what will happen. I can rarely go to anything because most people don't get it, they think I'm annoying even, to be asking how things will go, saying I should relax and go with the flow. I can't do that!

I hate this glorification! Being anxious does not make me more organized, it makes me petrified! It does not help me at all! It's not ""cool"" or ""edgy"" to be anxious, it's sometimes (most times) a horrible handicap. It does not make me an eventual better wife, it just sucks in a romantic relationship, second guessing every tone change, every wording, every glance and fearing I am not enough or too much, fearing I'm pushing people away but wishing with all my being I could do that because it would mean not having to calculate when I have to call them/give a sign I'm still alive and interested in their life, because I am... but I suck at keeping touch.

Being told my anxiety is only in my head and I should snap out of it, it hurts. It hurts because it affects me physically too and it's showing, and people don't get that being unable to have energy, being unable to sleep, being unable to enjoy any physical contact are side effects of me hurting so much ""only in my head"" It hurts so much and I wish I could switch it off, forget about it! It's like people confuses stress with anxiety. And I still haven't been to a doctor because I can't even dare to step into my school's nurse office, I run away. My best friend struggles with anxiety too and how come I can motivate her to reach out and support her, but can't take my own advices?

I've tried talking to my famiy about my anxiety issues and I was told I wasn't special and it was normal at my age, that I would grow out of it. I wouldn't dare to talk about it to the family members who would understand, because I feel like such a burden to everyone.

This is late night ramblings, I've been feeling down and empty recently and so angry at everything at the same time. 

I'm sorry. It's simply annoying to have to explain every day that I am anxious and don't know why, and no I can't help biting my nails or tapping my foot, it just happens while I'm so deep into my own head that I get lost in all the things I should be thinking about but can't in fear of having a full panic attack. It's difficult to make people who don't even know what anxiety feels like understand. It's difficult to make people who think they know understand. 

Many things going on at the same time, many responsibilities, many changes, and so little focus and composure to accomplish any of it...

While people with anxiety can be the most precious and kind and loving individuals in the world, anxiety is not pretty, it's not a likeable trait one should actively seek to develop or find in a partner. Anxiety is something people accept about others. Those who seek anxiety in a partner are likely to look for someone unstable to save or destroy, or both.

Don't like me because I'm anxious, like me because even if I'm anxious, I came to see you, support you and care for you, as friends, family and loved ones should do. 

If only they would stop wearing anxiety like a fashion statement, and thus help the misunderstanding around it die!

I see so many people on this sub struggle and I just want to say that you all are so awesome and strong. My problems are not as dire as yours, I see some of you trying so hard and it inspires me, but it also makes me so angry at the people who just want to look different and edgy and make you all look like your struggles are nothing but a cheap attempt to get attention. 

I'll stop now because this is getting more and more incoherent... Again, late night ramblings.... Sorry.
